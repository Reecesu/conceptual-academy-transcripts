It's a brightly colored, shell-less snail with winglike extensions that it uses for swimming. The amphipod, Hyperiella dilatata, resembles a small shrimp.\n\nLet's follow their research step by step, starting with observation. McClintock and Baker observed something unusual: a large percentage of amphipods were carrying sea butterflies on their backs, with the sea butterflies held tightly by the legs of the amphipods. Even more interesting, if an amphipod lost its sea butterfly, it would quickly seek another one—essentially abducting them!",
