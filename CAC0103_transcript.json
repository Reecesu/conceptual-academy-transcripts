Science is concerned with gathering knowledge about the natural world. When we apply this knowledge for practical purposes, we have what we call technology.",

      "content": ": That's a good starting point! From scientific discoveries, an engineer can design new technologies. New technologies, in turn, can be of assistance to scientists in conducting their research. The computer, for example, is technology scientists use on a daily basis. So, technology arises from science, but technology also supports scienceâ€”the two are different from each other but very much related.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's correct! It is tempting to blame technology itself for problems such as pollution, resource depletion, and even overpopulation. These problems, however, are not the fault of technology any more than a shotgun wound is the fault of the shotgun. It is humans who use the technology, and humans who must decide how to use it responsibly.",

    {

Whereas the paper on which the hard copy of a book is printed came from trees, paper can also come from fast-growing weeds, and less of even these materials will be needed as e-books gain popularity. In some parts of the world, progress is being made to stem the rapid growth of our human population, which is an issue that aggravates almost every problem faced by humans today.",

The greatest obstacle to solving today's problems lies more with social inertia than with a lack of technology. Technology is our tool. What we do with this tool is up to us. The promise of technology is a cleaner and healthier world. Wise applications of technology can lead to a better world.",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's part of it. The numerous benefits of technology are paired with risks. When the benefits of a technological innovation are seen to outweigh its risks, the technology is accepted and applied. X rays, for example, continue to be used for medical diagnosis despite their potential for causing cancer.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": When risks are perceived to outweigh the benefits, the technology tends to be used very sparingly or not at all. It's about weighing benefits against risks. Also, risk can vary for different groups. Aspirin is useful for adults, but for young children it can cause a potentially lethal condition known as Reye's syndrome.",

Let me give you another example: Dumping raw sewage into the local river may pose little risk for a town located upstream, but for towns downstream the untreated sewage is a health hazard. Similarly, storing radioactive wastes underground may pose little risk for us today, but for future generations the risks of such storage are greater if there is leakage into groundwater.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes, and this is why these issues are complex. Technologies involve different risks and benefits for different people, raising questions that are often hotly debated. Which medications should be sold over the counter to the general public, and how should they be labeled? Should food be irradiated in order to put an end to food poisoning, which kills more than 5000 Americans each year? The risks to all members of society need to be considered when public policies are decided.",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's an insightful observation! People seem to have difficulty accepting the impossibility of zero risk. You cannot go to the beach without risking skin cancer, no matter how much sunscreen you apply. You cannot avoid radioactivity, for it occurs naturally in the air you breathe and the foods you eat.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Science can help to determine relative risks. As the tools of science improve, the accuracy of risk assessment improves. Acceptance of risk, on the other hand, is a societal issue. Zero risk is not possible, and a society that accepts no risks receives no benefits.",

The tools of technology, however, can be used by scientists to further our understandings of nature. A case in point would be the telescope, which is a tool that permits us to learn about the stars. Science and technology are different, but they complement each other.",

A recently noted risk, however, is that many of these pharmaceuticals are now ending up in our drinking water, lakes, and streams. Although their concentrations are quite low, they are detectable, and these materials are being shown to have a measurable effect on species living in the water.",
