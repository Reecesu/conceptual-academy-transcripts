After testing, we would indeed find that the Moon is not made of cheese. Let me share a historical example of how hypotheses evolve through testing.</p><br><p>It was once believed that mass is lost as wood burns, because, clearly, ashes weigh less than the wood that burned. The 18th-century French chemist Antoine Lavoisier, however, was skeptical. To him it appeared that burning wood lost mass because it was losing gases to the atmosphere. He went on to hypothesize that during any chemical change, such as burning, mass transforms from one substance to another, but it is always conserved. This means that the total mass before the reaction is equal to the total mass after the reaction.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-28"><p>That's a common misconception. In fact, in the early 20th century, it was found that mass actually does change ever so slightly during a chemical reaction. The law of mass conservation, therefore, is not perfectly accurate. The change in mass during a chemical reaction, however, is exceedingly small and not easily measured. The law of mass conservation, therefore, still holds practical value, which is why it is still widely embraced.</p></div>

In everyday speech, a theory is no different from a hypothesis—an explanation for an observable phenomenon. A scientific theory, on the other hand, is a well-tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observations within the natural world.</p><br><p>Physicists, for instance, speak of the theory of relativity and use it to explain how we are held to Earth by gravity and how a strong gravitational field causes time to slow down. Biologists speak of the theory of natural selection and use it to explain both the unity and the diversity of life. Chemists speak of the theory of the atom and use it to explain how mass is seemingly conserved in a chemical reaction and how one material can transform into another.</p></div>

For example: Wood burns.<br>- A scientific hypothesis is a testable explanation for an observable phenomenon. For example: Wood transforms mostly to gaseous materials as it burns.<br>- A scientific law is an experimentally confirmed description of the natural world. For example: The mass of the products of a reaction equals the mass of the reactants.<br>- A scientific theory is a well-tested explanation that unifies many observations.

Consider what the world was like before the advent of scientific thinking, around the time of Galileo in the late 1500s. Since that time, science has revealed much about the workings of the natural universe. With this knowledge arose society-changing technologies.</p><br><p>For transportation, we've gone from horses to trains to cars to airplanes to spaceships. With the development of agriculture and advances in medicine, the human population has grown from about 500 million to over 8 billion. The materials we've developed provide for everything from skyscrapers to computers to the medicines that protect our health and prolong our lives. For better or for worse, science has had and will continue to have a huge impact on society.</p></div>

How can I help you today?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Hi Alia. I need to learn about how science works for my general education requirement. I've never been very good at science, so I'm a bit nervous about this topic.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": I understand that feeling. Many students come to science with some apprehension, but I think you'll find this topic quite accessible. Today we can explore how science is a continuous learning process. Would you like to start by discussing what we already know about the natural world and how much more there is to discover?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Sure, that sounds like a good place to start. So scientists already know everything about how the world works, right?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's actually a common misconception. Through science we have already learned much about nature. That said, as any scientist would tell you, there is still much more we have yet to learn. Science is a work in progress. The understandings we have one year will not necessarily be the understandings we have the next year.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wait, so science changes? I thought facts were supposed to be permanent and unchanging.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": It's common to think of a fact as something unchanging and absolute. But in science, a fact is something agreed upon by competent observers as being true. Interestingly, what humans accept to be factual changes over time as we learn new ideas. It was once an accepted fact that the universe is unchanging and permanent. Today, we recognize the fact that the universe is expanding and evolving.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's kind of confusing. So what's true today might not be true tomorrow?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": It's not that truth itself changes, but rather our understanding of truth improves as we gather more evidence. Let's talk about how scientists develop these understandings. Have you heard the term \"hypothesis\" before?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Yeah, that's like an educated guess, right?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Close. A hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an observable phenomenon. A hypothesis becomes a scientific hypothesis when, and only when, it can be tested through experiments. The more tests that the scientific hypothesis passes, the greater the confidence we have that the hypothesis is true. However, if the hypothesis fails even one test, then the hypothesis is taken to be false. A new, more encompassing hypothesis is needed.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So a scientific hypothesis has to be something you can actually test?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Exactly! Let me check your understanding: When does a hypothesis become a scientific hypothesis?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I think it becomes a scientific hypothesis when you can test it through experiments, right?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's correct! A hypothesis becomes scientific specifically when it can be tested experimentally. Let me give you a concept check to solidify this idea. Which of these statements is a scientific hypothesis: 1) The Moon is made of Swiss cheese, or 2) Human consciousness arises from an essence that is undetectable.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Hmm... both sound like hypotheses, but I think the first one is scientific because we could test if the Moon is made of Swiss cheese. The second one says it's \"undetectable\" so we couldn't really test that.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Excellent reasoning! Both statements attempt to explain observed phenomena, so both are hypotheses. But only statement 1 is testable, and therefore only statement 1 is a scientific hypothesis.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I see. But being testable doesn't make it true, right? The Moon isn't actually made of cheese!", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a great point! Being testable doesn't make a hypothesis correct - it just makes it scientific. After testing, we would indeed find that the Moon is not made of cheese. Let me share a historical example of how hypotheses evolve through testing.\n\nIt was once believed that mass is lost as wood burns, because, clearly, ashes weigh less than the wood that burned. The 18th-century French chemist Antoine Lavoisier, however, was skeptical. To him it appeared that burning wood lost mass because it was losing gases to the atmosphere. He went on to hypothesize that during any chemical change, such as burning, mass transforms from one substance to another, but it is always conserved. This means that the total mass before the reaction is equal to the total mass after the reaction.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So how did he test that? It seems hard to weigh gases.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Great question! To test this hypothesis, Lavoisier conducted experiments during which burning took place in a sealed chamber. He found that the chamber and its contents weighed the same before and after the burning. The old hypothesis didn't fit this observation. Lavoisier's new hypothesis was a better alternative.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's clever! He trapped the gases so they couldn't escape, and then weighed everything together.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Exactly! And did you know that Lavoisier was not just a brilliant scientist but also a civic-minded individual? He established free schools, advocated for fire hydrants, and designed street lamps to make travel through urban neighborhoods safer at night. His wife, Marie-Anne, also assisted him in many of his experiments.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I didn't know scientists did things like that. So what happened with his hypothesis about mass? Did it become something more?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, it did. When a hypothesis has been tested and supported by experimental data over and over again and has not been contradicted, it may become formally stated as a scientific law, or principle. Lavoisier's conservation of mass hypothesis was repeatedly confirmed over many years, so it became known as the law of mass conservation, which we discuss in more detail in Chapter 9.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So a law is basically a hypothesis that's been proven true many times?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Almost, but with an important distinction. Remember, the goal of science is to describe the rules of nature as accurately as possible. Ideally, a scientific law matches perfectly with the rules of nature. In practice, however, our so-called \"laws\" are merely our best approximations. If a scientific law is eventually found to be inaccurate through reproducible and verifiable evidence, then the law\u2014in order to be closer to reality\u2014must be modified or changed.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wait, so even laws can change? I thought once something became a law, it was set in stone.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a common misconception. In fact, in the early 20th century, it was found that mass actually does change ever so slightly during a chemical reaction. The law of mass conservation, therefore, is not perfectly accurate. The change in mass during a chemical reaction, however, is exceedingly small and not easily measured. The law of mass conservation, therefore, still holds practical value, which is why it is still widely embraced.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Interesting. So we still teach it because it's close enough for most situations?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Exactly! Now, let's talk about theories. How do you understand the word \"theory\" in everyday speech?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": In everyday language, when someone says \"it's just a theory,\" they usually mean it's just a guess or an idea without much evidence.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a good observation about common usage. Scientists use the word theory in a way that differs from its usage in everyday speech. In everyday speech, a theory is no different from a hypothesis\u2014an explanation for an observable phenomenon. A scientific theory, on the other hand, is a well-tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observations within the natural world.\n\nPhysicists, for instance, speak of the theory of relativity and use it to explain how we are held to Earth by gravity and how a strong gravitational field causes time to slow down. Biologists speak of the theory of natural selection and use it to explain both the unity and the diversity of life. Chemists speak of the theory of the atom and use it to explain how mass is seemingly conserved in a chemical reaction and how one material can transform into another.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So in science, a theory is actually much stronger than a hypothesis? It sounds like theories are really important in science.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": You're absolutely right. Theories are a foundation of science, but, like facts, hypotheses, and laws, they are not fixed. Rather, they evolve as they go through stages of redefinition and refinement so as to mirror nature as accurately as possible. Since it was first proposed 200 years ago, for example, the theory of the atom has been repeatedly refined as new evidence about atomic behavior has been gathered.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I've heard people dismiss evolution by saying \"it's just a theory,\" but it sounds like they don't understand what a scientific theory actually is.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's an insightful observation! Those who know little about science may argue that scientific theories have little value because they are always being modified. Those who understand science, however, see it differently. Science is self-correcting, and its theories grow stronger as they are modified.\n\nLet me summarize what we mean by these terms:\n- A scientific fact is an agreed upon truth about the natural world. For example: Wood burns.\n- A scientific hypothesis is a testable explanation for an observable phenomenon. For example: Wood transforms mostly to gaseous materials as it burns.\n- A scientific law is an experimentally confirmed description of the natural world. For example: The mass of the products of a reaction equals the mass of the reactants.\n- A scientific theory is a well-tested explanation that unifies many observations. For example: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms that are not destroyed during a chemical transformation.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That helps clarify things. Can science explain everything about our world and existence?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a thoughtful question. The domain of science is restricted to the observable natural world. While scientific methods can be used to debunk various claims, science has no way of verifying testimonies involving the supernatural. The term supernatural literally means \"above nature.\" Science works within nature, not above it.\n\nLikewise, science is unable to answer such philosophical questions as \"What is the purpose of life?\" or such religious questions as \"What is the nature of the human spirit?\" Though these questions are valid and have great importance to us, they rely on subjective personal experience and do not lead to testable hypotheses.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I guess that makes sense. Science has its limits. But why should we learn science if it can't answer everything?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a fair question. Just as you can't enjoy a ball game, computer game, or party game until you know its rules, so it is with nature. Because science helps us learn the rules of nature, it also helps us appreciate nature. You may see beauty in a tree, but you'll see more beauty in that tree when you realize that it was created from substances found not in the ground but primarily in the air\u2014specifically, the carbon dioxide and water put into the air by respiring organisms such as yourself.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wait, trees are made from air? I always thought they grew from the soil!", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": It's a common misconception! The tree is made primarily from carbon dioxide and water, the very same chemicals you release through your breath. In return, the tree releases oxygen, which you use to sustain your life. We are one with our environment down to the level of atoms and molecules.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's amazing. I never thought about it that way before.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Learning science builds new perspectives and is not unlike climbing a mountain. Each step builds on the previous step, while the view grows evermore astounding.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I can see how science gives us a new way of looking at things. Are there any other practical reasons to learn science?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, there are many practical reasons for which we should become familiar with science. Consider what the world was like before the advent of scientific thinking, around the time of Galileo in the late 1500s. Since that time, science has revealed much about the workings of the natural universe. With this knowledge arose society-changing technologies.\n\nFor transportation, we've gone from horses to trains to cars to airplanes to spaceships. With the development of agriculture and advances in medicine, the human population has grown from about 500 million to over 8 billion. The materials we've developed provide for everything from skyscrapers to computers to the medicines that protect our health and prolong our lives. For better or for worse, science has had and will continue to have a huge impact on society.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": When you put it that way, science really has changed everything about how we live.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Indeed. And there's an important aspect to consider for our future. We are now awakening to the fact that the resources of our planet are limited. Should we pay no attention and consume and pollute as we wish? Should we abandon the understandings of nature we've gained through science and merely hope for the best? Or should we embrace these understandings and move toward living on this planet in a sustainable fashion? Are the decisions we now and will soon face better met with ignorance or with knowledge?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I think knowledge is definitely better. I never really thought about science as being so relevant to my life and future before. This has given me a lot to think about. I'm still not sure I'll be great at science, but I can see why it matters.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": I'm glad to hear that! Science literacy is important for everyone, not just future scientists. Even if you don't pursue a scientific career, understanding how science works helps you make informed decisions about many aspects of your life. And remember, science is accessible to everyone willing to engage with it - it's not about being \"good at science\" but about being curious and thinking critically. Would you like to explore any other aspects of how science works?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I think I've got a good start for now. Thanks for explaining all this. It makes more sense than I expected!", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": You're welcome! Remember that science is a journey of discovery, and it's perfectly fine to take it one step at a time. I hope you continue to develop your understanding and appreciation of the scientific process. Let me know if you have any other questions as you continue learning.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}], "version": "1.0", "utc_timestamp": 1742534359.970463, "full_hash": ""}`);
