Let me share a historical example of how hypotheses evolve through testing.\n\nIt was once believed that mass is lost as wood burns, because, clearly, ashes weigh less than the wood that burned. The 18th-century French chemist Antoine Lavoisier, however, was skeptical. To him it appeared that burning wood lost mass because it was losing gases to the atmosphere. He went on to hypothesize that during any chemical change, such as burning, mass transforms from one substance to another, but it is always conserved. This means that the total mass before the reaction is equal to the total mass after the reaction.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Great question! To test this hypothesis, Lavoisier conducted experiments during which burning took place in a sealed chamber. He found that the chamber and its contents weighed the same before and after the burning. The old hypothesis didn't fit this observation. Lavoisier's new hypothesis was a better alternative.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Exactly! And did you know that Lavoisier was not just a brilliant scientist but also a civic-minded individual? He established free schools, advocated for fire hydrants, and designed street lamps to make travel through urban neighborhoods safer at night. His wife, Marie-Anne, also assisted him in many of his experiments.",

      "feedback": null

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes, it did. When a hypothesis has been tested and supported by experimental data over and over again and has not been contradicted, it may become formally stated as a scientific law, or principle. Lavoisier's conservation of mass hypothesis was repeatedly confirmed over many years, so it became known as the law of mass conservation, which we discuss in more detail in Chapter 9.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Almost, but with an important distinction. Remember, the goal of science is to describe the rules of nature as accurately as possible. Ideally, a scientific law matches perfectly with the rules of nature. In practice, however, our so-called \"laws\" are merely our best approximations. If a scientific law is eventually found to be inaccurate through reproducible and verifiable evidence, then the law—in order to be closer to reality—must be modified or changed.",

The law of mass conservation, therefore, is not perfectly accurate. The change in mass during a chemical reaction, however, is exceedingly small and not easily measured. The law of mass conservation, therefore, still holds practical value, which is why it is still widely embraced.",

In everyday speech, a theory is no different from a hypothesis—an explanation for an observable phenomenon. A scientific theory, on the other hand, is a well-tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observations within the natural world.\n\nPhysicists, for instance, speak of the theory of relativity and use it to explain how we are held to Earth by gravity and how a strong gravitational field causes time to slow down. Biologists speak of the theory of natural selection and use it to explain both the unity and the diversity of life. Chemists speak of the theory of the atom and use it to explain how mass is seemingly conserved in a chemical reaction and how one material can transform into another.",

Those who understand science, however, see it differently. Science is self-correcting, and its theories grow stronger as they are modified.\n\nLet me summarize what we mean by these terms:\n- A scientific fact is an agreed upon truth about the natural world. For example: Wood burns.\n- A scientific hypothesis is a testable explanation for an observable phenomenon. For example: Wood transforms mostly to gaseous materials as it burns.\n- A scientific law is an experimentally confirmed description of the natural world. For example: The mass of the products of a reaction equals the mass of the reactants.\n- A scientific theory is a well-tested explanation that unifies many observations. For example: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms that are not destroyed during a chemical transformation.",

While scientific methods can be used to debunk various claims, science has no way of verifying testimonies involving the supernatural. The term supernatural literally means \"above nature.\" Science works within nature, not above it.\n\nLikewise, science is unable to answer such philosophical questions as \"What is the purpose of life?\" or such religious questions as \"What is the nature of the human spirit?\" Though these questions are valid and have great importance to us, they rely on subjective personal experience and do not lead to testable hypotheses.",

With this knowledge arose society-changing technologies.\n\nFor transportation, we've gone from horses to trains to cars to airplanes to spaceships. With the development of agriculture and advances in medicine, the human population has grown from about 500 million to over 8 billion.
