Some examples of physical quantities you will be learning about and using include length, time, mass, weight, volume, energy, temperature, heat, and density.

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": In this book, we use SI units. On occasion, USCS units are also used to help you make comparisons. One major advantage of the metric system is that it uses a decimal system, which means all units are related to the next smaller or larger units by a factor of 10.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": It might seem that way at first, but it's quite straightforward once you understand the process. To convert from one unit to another, you need only multiply the given quantity by a conversion factor. A conversion factor is a ratio where the numerator and denominator represent the equivalent quantity expressed in different units.",
      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": I mean they represent the same amount, just expressed in different units. For example, we know that 100 centimeters equals 1 meter. Because any amount divided by the same amount is equal to one, all conversion factors are effectively equal to one.\n\nSo from this relationship (100 centimeters = 1 meter), we can create two conversion factors:\n1 meter/100 centimeters or 100 centimeters/1 meter",

      "feedback": null

      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes, but which one you choose depends on what you're trying to convert. Because all conversion factors are equal to 1, multiplying a quantity by a conversion factor doesn't change the value of the quantity. What does change are the units.\n\nLet me give you an example. Suppose you measured an item to be 60 centimeters in length. You can convert this measurement to meters by multiplying it by the conversion factor that allows you to cancel centimeters:\n\n60 centimeters × (1 meter/100 centimeters) = 0.60 meter",
      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": ": I see! So the centimeters on top and bottom cancel out, leaving me with meters. That's clever.",
      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Exactly! You can create two conversion factors for every equality. For example, from our tables we see that 1 kilometer equals 0.621 miles. To create these two conversion factors, show a unit as the numerator in one conversion factor but as a denominator in the other:\n\n1 km/0.621 mi or 0.621 mi/1 km",
      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": ": So if I wanted to convert miles to kilometers, I'd use the first one?",
      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Actually, you would use the second one. You always multiply the quantity provided to you by the conversion factor that shows the original unit in the denominator. This way, the original unit will be canceled, leaving you with the desired new unit.\n\nLet's try an example: A marathon is 26.2 miles. To convert this to kilometers, we multiply by the appropriate conversion factor, which has miles in the denominator:\n\n(26.2 miles) × (1 km/0.621 miles) = 42.2 km",
      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": ": Oh, so a marathon is 42.2 kilometers! I've heard that number before but didn't realize that's what it meant. So I just need to remember to put the unit I'm starting with on the bottom of the fraction?",
      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Exactly! Always be careful to write down your units. They are your ultimate guide, telling you what numbers go where and whether you are setting up the equation properly. You should set up a conversion factor so that the desired unit is always in the numerator and the unit to be cancelled is always in the denominator.",
      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": ": That helps. But what if I need to convert through multiple units, like going from centimeters to miles?",
      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Great question! Conversion factors can be combined to allow multiple conversions in a single equation. Let me walk you through an example: How many pounds are there in 48 ounces?",
      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "user",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's correct! But let's demonstrate how we could do this using a series of conversion factors. We could set up a string of conversion factors to transform 48 ounces into pounds—first from ounces to grams, then from grams to kilograms, and finally from kilograms to pounds:\n\n48 oz × (28.35 g/1 oz) × (1 kg/1000 g) × (2.205 lb/1 kg) = 3.0 lb",
      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": ": Wow, that's a longer way to do it, but I see how it works. You just keep multiplying by new conversion factors until you get to the unit you want.",
      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Exactly! Of course, this conversion could be done in a single step knowing that 16 ounces equals 1 pound. A string of conversion factors in a single equation, however, becomes quite useful when the direct conversion factor is unknown.",

      "feedback": null

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Correct! Now let's try another:\n\nb. Show that 235 kilograms is 518 pounds.\n   235 kg × (2.205 lb/1 kg) = 518 lb",
