      "feedback": null

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's covered by Rule 3: Zeros to the left of the first nonzero digit serve only to fix the position of the decimal point and are not significant.\nSo for your example:\n- 0.0068 has two significant figures (6 and 8)\n- 0.0427 has three significant figures (4, 2, and 7)\n- 0.0003506 has four significant figures (3, 5, 0, and 6)",
