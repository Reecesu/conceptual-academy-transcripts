      "content": ": That's right. Aristotle's model was a remarkable achievement for its day, and people found it made practical sense. For example, when pottery is made, wet clay changes to ceramic because the heat of the fire drives out the moist quality of the wet clay and replaces it with the dry quality of the ceramic.\n\nAristotle combined these four qualities to explain all materials. Hot and dry gave fire, moist and cold gave water, hot and moist gave air, and dry and cold gave earth. He supposed that a hard substance like rock contained mostly the dry quality, and a soft substance like clay contained more of the moist quality.",

A major breakthrough came in the late 1700s when the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier discovered the law of mass conservation, which we discussed earlier as matter not being created or destroyed in ordinary chemical reactions.\n\nThis verifiable law ran counter to Aristotle's idea that matter could lose or gain mass as its hot, dry, cold, or moist qualities changed. Lavoisier further hypothesized that an element is any material made of a fundamental substance that cannot be broken down into anything else.",

After hearing appeals to spare his life, the judge determined that \"the Republic needs neither scientists nor chemists; the course of justice cannot be delayed.\" About 18 months after Lavoisier's execution, the French government sent a formal apology to his widow, Marie-Anne.",

We now know atoms can be split in nuclear reactions, and we've discovered isotopes, which are atoms of the same element with different masses. But for ordinary chemical reactions, his model worked remarkably well.\n\nJohn Dalton came from a very poor family, and although his formal schooling ended at age 11, he continued to learn on his own and even began teaching others when he was only 12. His primary research interest was weather, which led him to conduct many experiments with gases. Soon after publishing his conclusions on the atomic nature of matter, his reputation as a first-rate scientist increased rapidly.",

Students adored him and would fill lecture halls to hear him speak about chemistry. Much of his work on the periodic table occurred in his spare time following his lectures.

In order to achieve this pattern, however, he had to shift some elements left or right occasionally. This left gaps—blank spaces that could not be filled by any known element.",

His predictions about the properties of some of those missing elements led to their discovery.\n\nThat Mendeleev was able to predict the properties of new elements helped convince many scientists of the accuracy of Dalton's atomic hypothesis, upon which Mendeleev's periodic table was based. This in turn helped promote Dalton's proposed atomic nature of matter from a hypothesis to a more widely accepted theory. Mendeleev's chart ultimately led to our modern periodic table, which we'll discuss more fully later.",

From crude oil we can make fuels, plastics, clothing, and more. From thin air we can produce fertilizer.\n\nVirtually every aspect of modern society has been and will continue to be affected by our ability to manipulate atoms to meet our needs.
