One reason for this is because each lead atom has more mass. The lead, having more mass per volume, is therefore more dense.

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Indeed it does. As we'll discuss more in Section 2.6, the volume of a material changes with temperature. A change in temperature, therefore, can also result in a change in density, even though the mass of the object stays the same.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes! This effect is particularly noticeable with gases. Gas densities are much more affected by pressure and temperature than are the densities of solids and liquids. With an increase in pressure, gas molecules are squeezed closer together. This makes for less volume (but the same mass) and therefore greater density.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's a perfect example! The density of the air inside a diver's breathing tank, for instance, is much greater than the density of air at normal atmospheric pressure.\n\nTemperature also affects density. With an increase in temperature, gas molecules move faster and thus have a tendency to push outward, thereby occupying a greater volume. Thus, hot air is less dense than cold air, which is why hot air rises.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Precisely! The hot air inside a hot air balloon is less dense than the surrounding colder air, which is why the balloon rises. You're making excellent connections.",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's a common point of confusion. Let's think about it: density is mass divided by volume. For water, 1 gram occupies 1 milliliter, and 10 grams occupies 10 milliliters. So the density would be:\n1 gram / 1 milliliter = 1 g/mL\n10 grams / 10 milliliters = 1 g/mL\n\nSo what do you think?",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",

      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": ": Well... I need to think about this. Lead is denser than aluminum in general. So even though 10 grams of aluminum is more mass than 1 gram of lead, the lead is still more dense, right?",
      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": You've got it! The lead has greater density. Density is mass per volume, and this ratio is greater for any amount of lead than for any amount of aluminum.",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": ": This is starting to make sense to me now. Is there a way to calculate mass or volume if I know density?",
      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Absolutely! With a little algebraic manipulation, it's easy to change the equation for density around so that it can be solved for either mass or volume. Let me show you:\n\nFrom Density = Mass / Volume,\nwe can derive:\nMass = Density × Volume\nVolume = Mass / Density\n\nA good way to remember these relationships is to use a simple triangle diagram. If you cover the quantity you want to know with your finger, the remaining quantities show how to calculate it. For example, covering the M shows that mass is equal to density times volume, D × V.",
