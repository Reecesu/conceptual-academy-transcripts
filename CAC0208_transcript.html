Many students find these concepts challenging at first, but I think you'll find gas laws quite interesting because they explain so many everyday phenomena. Gas laws were developed by scientists in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries who investigated the relationships among pressure, volume, and temperature of gaseous materials. These laws help us understand the behavior of gases, including the air we breathe. Let's start with Boyle's Law, which describes the relationship between pressure and volume.</p></div>

Inside the tire, the molecules behave like zillions of tiny Ping-Pong balls, perpetually moving helter-skelter and banging against the inner walls. Their impacts on the inner surface of the tire produce a jittery force that appears to our coarse senses as a steady outward push. Averaging this pushing force over a unit of area gives the pressure of the enclosed air.</p></div>

If the molecules move with the same average kinetic energy, or, equivalently, if their temperature is the same, then, to a close approximation, the number of collisions will be doubled.

If the piston is pushed downward so that the volume is half the original volume, the density of molecules will double and the pressure will correspondingly double. In general, a lessening of the volume means a correspondingly greater pressure because the gas density is greater, while a larger volume means a correspondingly smaller pressure because the gas density is less.</p></div>

Boyle discovered that as volume decreases, pressure increases, and as volume increases, pressure decreases. Similarly, an increase in pressure results in a smaller volume, while a decrease in pressure results in a larger volume. Boyle's Law, however, holds true only assuming that the temperature and number of gas particles remain the same.</p></div>

The 18th-century French scientist and daring balloon aviator Jacques Charles (1746–1823) discovered the direct relationship between the volume of a gas and its temperature at constant pressure. Charles showed that the volume of a gas increases as its temperature increases. Likewise, the volume of a gas decreases as its temperature decreases.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-26"><p>You're absolutely correct. The volume of a gas never reaches zero. Somewhere along the way the gas transforms into a liquid. Nonetheless, in 1848, William Thomson, also known as Lord Kelvin (1824–1907), recognized that this convergent temperature of –273.15°C would be a convenient zero point for an alternative temperature scale by which the absolute motion of particles could be measured. The number 0 is assigned to this lowest possible temperature—absolute zero. Accordingly, this scale became known as the Kelvin temperature scale, as was introduced earlier in the textbook.</p><br><p>According to Charles's Law, the volume and absolute temperature (measured in kelvins) of a gas are directly proportional—as one gets bigger, so does the other. This can be represented as:</p><br><p>V₁/T₁ = V₂/T₂</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-30"><p>Exactly! Science has a rich history of discovery leading to practical applications. Now, let's discuss Avogadro's Law, which relates volume and the number of particles. The 19th-century Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro hypothesized that the volume of a gas is a function of the number of gas particles it contains. In other words, as the number of gas particles increases, so does the volume, assuming a constant pressure and temperature. This relationship is known as Avogadro's Law. An easy way to demonstrate this law is to grasp the opening of an empty plastic bag and blow into it. The more air molecules you blow into the bag, the bigger its volume. This can be represented as:</p><br><p>V₁/n₁ = V₂/n₂</p></div>

The properties of a gas can be described by four interrelated quantities: pressure, volume, temperature, and number of particles. Boyle's, Charles's, and Avogadro's gas laws each describe how one quantity varies relative to another as long as the remaining two are held constant. Mathematically, these three laws can be combined into a single law, called the ideal gas law, which shows the relationship of all these quantities in a single equation:</p><br><p>PV = nRT</p><br><p>where P is the pressure of the gas, V is its volume, n is the number of gas particles, and T is the temperature. The R in this equation is the gas constant, which is the same no matter what the identity of the gas. Its value depends only upon the chosen units of pressure, volume, and temperature.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-40"><p>That's exactly right! The ideal gas law gets its name from the fact that it accurately describes only an ideal gas. Such a gas is one in which individual gas particles are considered to occupy no volume in their container. Furthermore, the particles of an ideal gas experience no attractions to or repulsions from one another.</p><br><p>Each particle of a real gas, however, does have volume, albeit very, very small. Also, these particles do interact with each other. Real gases, therefore, do not follow any of the gas laws perfectly. At normal pressures, however, the contribution of particle size to total volume is insignificant and gas laws are good predictors of gas behavior. Furthermore, when the temperature of the gas is well above its boiling point, the gas particles are moving so fast that they rebound off one another without sticking. The interactions, therefore, are negligible, so the particles closely resemble those of an ideal gas.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-46"><p>Exactly right! Gas laws work best for gases at low pressures and high temperatures. The air we breathe is a good example. At atmospheric pressure, the distances between air molecules are much greater than the sizes of the air molecules. Also, air is well above its components' boiling points (N₂ boils at –196°C and O₂ at –183°C). This behavior permitted the gas law discoveries of Boyle, Charles, Avogadro, and others.</p><br><p>Now, from the gas laws a model has been developed that gives us insight as to why gases behave as they do. This model, known as the kinetic molecular theory, can be summarized as a set of five postulates:</p><br><p>1. A gas consists of tiny particles, either atoms or molecules or both.</p><br><p>2. Gas particles are in constant random motion, colliding with one another and with the walls of their container.</p><br><p>3. The impacts of gas particles on the walls of the container produce a jittery force that appears as a steady push against the inner surface. This pushing force provides the pressure of the enclosed gas.</p><br><p>4. Deviations from gas laws arise primarily because of the interactions occurring among gas particles and because gas particles are not infinitely small.</p><br><p>5. The average kinetic energy (energy due to motion) of the gas particles is directly proportional to the temperature of the gas.</p></div>

The kinetic molecular theory was developed from the study of gases, but this theory also nicely sums up what we know about liquids and solids. As discussed earlier in the textbook, liquids and solids are also made of tiny particles, either atoms or molecules. These particles are in constant random motion. This motion is confined, however, because the particles are held together by electrical attractions.</p><br><p>In the liquid phase, the particles can tumble over one another like marbles in a bag, which gives the liquid its fluid character. In the solid phase, the particles are held together so strongly that they can only vibrate about fixed positions. </p><br><p>Kinetic molecular theory also tells us that the higher the temperature, the faster the movement of the particles. This explains why liquids and solids, like gases, also tend to expand when heated and contract when cooled.</p></div>

(underwater)</p><br><p>Using Boyle's Law: P₁V₁ = P₂V₂<br>We can rearrange to solve for P₂:<br>P₂ = (P₁V₁)/V₂<br>P₂ = (1.00 atm × 5.00 liters)/3.38 liters<br>P₂ = 1.48 atmospheres</p><br><p>This shows that the pressure at 5.00 meters underwater is 1.48 atmospheres.</p></div>

Think of the molecules of air inside an inflated tire of an automobile. Inside the tire, the molecules behave like zillions of tiny Ping-Pong balls, perpetually moving helter-skelter and banging against the inner walls.

Averaging this pushing force over a unit of area gives the pressure of the enclosed air.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Oh, so pressure is essentially all these tiny molecules hitting the walls of whatever contains them?

Now, suppose the temperature is kept constant and twice as many molecules are pumped into the same volume. Then the air density\u2014the number of molecules per given volume\u2014is doubled. If the molecules move with the same average kinetic energy, or, equivalently, if their temperature is the same, then, to a close approximation, the number of collisions will be doubled. This means that the pressure is doubled.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So more molecules in the same space means more collisions with the walls, which means more pressure.

In general, a lessening of the volume means a correspondingly greater pressure because the gas density is greater, while a larger volume means a correspondingly smaller pressure because the gas density is less.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wait, so this means when I compress the air in a bicycle pump, I'm increasing the pressure by reducing the volume and packing more air molecules closer together?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's precisely right! You've just described a real-world application of what we're learning. Notice in the example involving the piston that volume and pressure are inversely proportional\u2014as one gets bigger, the other gets smaller. This can be represented as:\n\nP\u2081V\u2081 = P\u2082V\u2082\n\nThis relationship is known as Boyle's Law, after the 17th-century scientist Robert Boyle (1627\u20131691) who first described it. Boyle discovered that as volume decreases, pressure increases, and as volume increases, pressure decreases. Similarly, an increase in pressure results in a smaller volume, while a decrease in pressure results in a larger volume. Boyle's Law, however, holds true only assuming that the temperature and number of gas particles remain the same.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I think I understand, but I'm curious\u2014are there any surprising examples where this affects us in everyday life?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Let me share two examples with you. First, have you ever tried to use a snorkel for swimming deep underwater?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I've used a snorkel at the surface, but I don't think I've tried going deep with one.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Well, if you bring a long snorkel with you to the bottom of a deep swimming pool, the snorkel provides a direct path between your lungs and the air above, but you still can't breathe through it. Do you have any idea why?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Hmm... is it because the water pressure is pushing against our lungs too hard?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Exactly! The weight of the water above you squeezes you from all directions. This water is very heavy, and your lungs are not strong enough to expand against all this pressure. That's why all snorkels are short.\n\nHere's another example: A scuba diver swimming underwater breathes compressed air, which counteracts the water pressure, allowing her to breathe. If she then holds her breath while returning to the surface, what do you think happens to the volume of air in her lungs?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Based on what we've discussed about Boyle's Law... as she moves up, the water pressure decreases, so I guess the volume of air would increase?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Exactly right! As she rises to the surface, the water pressure decreases, which allows the compressed air in her lungs to expand in accordance with Boyle's Law. Rising 10 m to the surface results in half the pressure, which results in a doubling of the volume. This is enough to burst the lungs. A first lesson in scuba diving is not to hold your breath while ascending\u2014to do so can be fatal.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wow, I never realized physics could be so directly connected to safety. That makes me think differently about these laws.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Gas laws are indeed very practical. Now, let's move on to Charles's Law, which describes the relationship between volume and temperature. The 18th-century French scientist and daring balloon aviator Jacques Charles (1746\u20131823) discovered the direct relationship between the volume of a gas and its temperature at constant pressure. Charles showed that the volume of a gas increases as its temperature increases. Likewise, the volume of a gas decreases as its temperature decreases.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Is this why balloons get smaller when you put them in the freezer?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's precisely it! Imagine two balloons inflated to the same size. If you heat one over some boiling water while the other cools down in the freezer, you'll find that the heated balloon expanded, while the cooled balloon became smaller.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": What would happen if you dipped an air-filled balloon into something super cold, like liquid nitrogen?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a fascinating question! If an air-filled balloon is dipped into \u2212196\u00b0C liquid nitrogen and then pulled back out, the balloon would initially shrink dramatically as the gas inside cools and contracts. Once removed and warmed back to room temperature, it would expand again. This perfectly demonstrates Charles's Law!\n\nRemarkably, when the volume and temperature of various gases at constant pressure are plotted on a graph, it appears that at a rather cold temperature, \u2013273.15\u00b0C, the volume of any gas dwindles down to zero.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": But a gas can't actually have zero volume, right? That doesn't seem possible.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": You're absolutely correct. The volume of a gas never reaches zero. Somewhere along the way the gas transforms into a liquid. Nonetheless, in 1848, William Thomson, also known as Lord Kelvin (1824\u20131907), recognized that this convergent temperature of \u2013273.15\u00b0C would be a convenient zero point for an alternative temperature scale by which the absolute motion of particles could be measured. The number 0 is assigned to this lowest possible temperature\u2014absolute zero. Accordingly, this scale became known as the Kelvin temperature scale, as was introduced earlier in the textbook.\n\nAccording to Charles's Law, the volume and absolute temperature (measured in kelvins) of a gas are directly proportional\u2014as one gets bigger, so does the other. This can be represented as:\n\nV\u2081/T\u2081 = V\u2082/T\u2082", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So let me see if I understand... if I have a perfectly elastic balloon holding helium and I warm it, the volume will increase because the temperature and volume are directly proportional?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, that's correct! According to Charles's Law, as a gas is warmed, its volume expands.\n\nDid you know that in 1783, Jacques Charles was the first to fly in a balloon filled with hydrogen gas, which he created by reacting scrap iron with sulfuric acid? Two weeks earlier, the Montgolfier brothers had been responsible for the first balloon flight using hot air. One of Charles's first flights over the French countryside lasted about 45 minutes and took him 15 miles to a small village, where the people were so terrified they tore the balloon to shreds.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's a cool historical tidbit! I'm starting to see how these scientific principles actually led to real inventions that changed history.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Exactly! Science has a rich history of discovery leading to practical applications. Now, let's discuss Avogadro's Law, which relates volume and the number of particles. The 19th-century Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro hypothesized that the volume of a gas is a function of the number of gas particles it contains. In other words, as the number of gas particles increases, so does the volume, assuming a constant pressure and temperature. This relationship is known as Avogadro's Law. An easy way to demonstrate this law is to grasp the opening of an empty plastic bag and blow into it. The more air molecules you blow into the bag, the bigger its volume. This can be represented as:\n\nV\u2081/n\u2081 = V\u2082/n\u2082", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That seems straightforward, but I have a question. If I have different types of gases, like oxygen versus water vapor, would the same volumes contain the same number of molecules?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's an excellent question! Assuming the same pressure and temperature, which has a greater number of gas particles: 5 liters of gaseous water, H\u2082O, or 5 liters of gaseous oxygen, O\u2082?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I'm not sure... I guess I'd be tempted to say oxygen because it seems simpler, but I'm not confident.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": According to Avogadro's Law, the same volume means the same number of gas particles. Each particle here refers to a single molecule of either water, H\u2082O, or oxygen, O\u2082. There are just as many water gas particles in 5 liters as there are oxygen gas particles. The nature of the gas particles doesn't matter.\n\nBut here's a follow-up question: which has a greater number of atoms?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Oh, that's different! Water has 3 atoms per molecule (H\u2082O), while oxygen gas has 2 atoms per molecule (O\u2082). So I think 5 liters of water vapor would have more total atoms than 5 liters of oxygen gas.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Exactly right! You're making great connections.\n\nNow, let's discuss how all these gas laws come together. The properties of a gas can be described by four interrelated quantities: pressure, volume, temperature, and number of particles. Boyle's, Charles's, and Avogadro's gas laws each describe how one quantity varies relative to another as long as the remaining two are held constant. Mathematically, these three laws can be combined into a single law, called the ideal gas law, which shows the relationship of all these quantities in a single equation:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure of the gas, V is its volume, n is the number of gas particles, and T is the temperature. The R in this equation is the gas constant, which is the same no matter what the identity of the gas. Its value depends only upon the chosen units of pressure, volume, and temperature.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That seems like a lot to keep track of. What are the units for all these values?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": A commonly used value for the gas constant is 0.082057 L atm/K mol. Regarding the units, L is volume in liters, atm is pressure in atmospheres, K is temperature in kelvin, and 1 mole (mol) equals 6.02 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u00b3 particles. The concept of the mole is introduced in more detail later in the textbook.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So the four interrelated quantities we need to describe gas properties are pressure, volume, temperature, and number of particles, right?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's exactly right! The ideal gas law gets its name from the fact that it accurately describes only an ideal gas. Such a gas is one in which individual gas particles are considered to occupy no volume in their container. Furthermore, the particles of an ideal gas experience no attractions to or repulsions from one another.\n\nEach particle of a real gas, however, does have volume, albeit very, very small. Also, these particles do interact with each other. Real gases, therefore, do not follow any of the gas laws perfectly. At normal pressures, however, the contribution of particle size to total volume is insignificant and gas laws are good predictors of gas behavior. Furthermore, when the temperature of the gas is well above its boiling point, the gas particles are moving so fast that they rebound off one another without sticking. The interactions, therefore, are negligible, so the particles closely resemble those of an ideal gas.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I've noticed sometimes when I breathe on my hand with my mouth wide open it feels warm, but if I pucker my lips and blow, it feels cool. Is that related to gas laws?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's an excellent observation! With your mouth wide open, blow air from your lungs onto the palm of your hand. Now repeat the same procedure with your lips puckered so that your breath is compressed within your mouth and expands upon exiting. You'll discover that as air expands, it cools. In more technical terms, as the pressure decreases, so does the temperature.\n\nIn regard to the weather, as warm air rises, it expands into less dense higher-altitude air and thus cools. This cooling causes atmospheric water vapor to condense into tiny suspended droplets, which is how clouds are formed.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's really cool! So the gas laws explain cloud formation too? I'm starting to see how these concepts apply to tons of everyday phenomena. I'm curious though - when do gas laws work best and when do they break down?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a great question! Which do you think gas laws describe more accurately: a gas at high pressure and low temperature or a gas at low pressure and high temperature?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Hmm... based on what you said about ideal gases versus real gases, I'm guessing gas laws work better at low pressure and high temperature? Since that's when the gas particles would be bouncing around more and interacting less?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Exactly right! Gas laws work best for gases at low pressures and high temperatures. The air we breathe is a good example. At atmospheric pressure, the distances between air molecules are much greater than the sizes of the air molecules. Also, air is well above its components' boiling points (N\u2082 boils at \u2013196\u00b0C and O\u2082 at \u2013183\u00b0C). This behavior permitted the gas law discoveries of Boyle, Charles, Avogadro, and others.\n\nNow, from the gas laws a model has been developed that gives us insight as to why gases behave as they do. This model, known as the kinetic molecular theory, can be summarized as a set of five postulates:\n\n1. A gas consists of tiny particles, either atoms or molecules or both.\n\n2. Gas particles are in constant random motion, colliding with one another and with the walls of their container.\n\n3. The impacts of gas particles on the walls of the container produce a jittery force that appears as a steady push against the inner surface. This pushing force provides the pressure of the enclosed gas.\n\n4. Deviations from gas laws arise primarily because of the interactions occurring among gas particles and because gas particles are not infinitely small.\n\n5. The average kinetic energy (energy due to motion) of the gas particles is directly proportional to the temperature of the gas.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I think I understand the first three postulates pretty well now. The fourth one explains why gas laws aren't perfect, and the fifth one connects temperature to how fast the particles are moving. It's all starting to make sense.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's great! We can use these postulates to rationalize the various gas laws. For Boyle's Law, pressure decreases with increasing volume because collisions of the gas particles with the walls of the container occur less frequently, and those impacts are spread out over a greater area.\n\nFor Charles's Law, volume increases with increasing temperatures because faster-moving particles push against the inner sides of the container more forcefully, which causes an expansion. \n\nSimilarly, for Avogadro's Law, volume increases with an increasing number of particles because each particle produces a force on the inner sides of the container, and when there are a greater number of particles, the net force on the inner surface is also greater.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I'm starting to see how this kinetic molecular theory explains all the gas laws. Does this theory apply only to gases, or to liquids and solids too?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Another excellent question! The kinetic molecular theory was developed from the study of gases, but this theory also nicely sums up what we know about liquids and solids. As discussed earlier in the textbook, liquids and solids are also made of tiny particles, either atoms or molecules. These particles are in constant random motion. This motion is confined, however, because the particles are held together by electrical attractions.\n\nIn the liquid phase, the particles can tumble over one another like marbles in a bag, which gives the liquid its fluid character. In the solid phase, the particles are held together so strongly that they can only vibrate about fixed positions. \n\nKinetic molecular theory also tells us that the higher the temperature, the faster the movement of the particles. This explains why liquids and solids, like gases, also tend to expand when heated and contract when cooled.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Is that why roads and bridges sometimes have those gaps in them? I've noticed those but never really understood why they're there.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, exactly! Those gaps in roadways of bridges are called expansion joints; they allow the bridge to expand and contract. The next time you see one, you can try to determine whether it's a warm day or a cold day based on how wide the gap is.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's a cool application! I have another question: if we have a gas in a container with a fixed volume, and we heat it up, what happens to the pressure?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Let's think about that. Assuming a constant volume and number of particles, as the temperature of a gas increases, what happens to the pressure? And why?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Well, if the temperature increases, the molecules move faster. If they're moving faster in the same amount of space, they would hit the walls more often and with more force... so I think the pressure would increase?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's exactly right! As the temperature increases in a gas, so does the average kinetic energy (speed) of its particles. Faster-moving particles collide more frequently with the inner surface of a container and strike it harder. More frequent and more forceful impacts mean greater pressure. So, as the temperature of a gas increases, so does its pressure, provided the volume and number of gas particles remain constant.\n\nUnderstanding this, can you explain why the pressure inside an automobile tire is greatest just after driving?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Oh! That makes sense. When we drive, the friction of the tires on the road generates heat, warming up the air inside the tires. As the air warms up, its pressure increases because the molecules are moving faster and hitting the inside of the tire with more force.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Perfect explanation! Now, let's look at how we can apply these gas laws mathematically to solve real-world problems.

Here's one: A hot air balloon 401,000 liters in volume is warmed from 298 K to 398 K. As the air inside the balloon expands, it is unable to stretch the fabric, which is not very elastic. Instead, the expanded air escapes out of a hole placed at the top of the balloon. How much air escapes?\n\nLet's think about this. We know:\nV\u2081 = 401,000 liters\nT\u2081 = 298 K\nT\u2082 = 398 K\n\nIf the balloon were elastic, the new volume would be:\nV\u2082 = V\u2081(T\u2082/T\u2081)\nV\u2082 = 401,000 liters \u00d7 (398 K/298 K)\nV\u2082 = 401,000 liters \u00d7 1.336\nV\u2082 = 536,000 liters\n\nBut since the balloon can't expand, it stays at 401,000 liters, and the excess air escapes:\nAir escaped = 536,000 liters - 401,000 liters = 135,000 liters", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I'm impressed by how these calculations can help predict exactly what will happen in real-world situations.
