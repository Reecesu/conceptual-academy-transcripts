The number 0 is assigned to this lowest possible temperature—absolute zero. Accordingly, this scale became known as the Kelvin temperature scale, as was introduced earlier in the textbook.\n\nAccording to Charles's Law, the volume and absolute temperature (measured in kelvins) of a gas are directly proportional—as one gets bigger, so does the other.

In other words, as the number of gas particles increases, so does the volume, assuming a constant pressure and temperature. This relationship is known as Avogadro's Law.

Mathematically, these three laws can be combined into a single law, called the ideal gas law, which shows the relationship of all these quantities in a single equation:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure of the gas, V is its volume, n is the number of gas particles, and T is the temperature.

Also, these particles do interact with each other. Real gases, therefore, do not follow any of the gas laws perfectly. At normal pressures, however, the contribution of particle size to total volume is insignificant and gas laws are good predictors of gas behavior. Furthermore, when the temperature of the gas is well above its boiling point, the gas particles are moving so fast that they rebound off one another without sticking.

This model, known as the kinetic molecular theory, can be summarized as a set of five postulates:\n\n1. A gas consists of tiny particles, either atoms or molecules or both.\n\n2. Gas particles are in constant random motion, colliding with one another and with the walls of their container.\n\n3. The impacts of gas particles on the walls of the container produce a jittery force that appears as a steady push against the inner surface. This pushing force provides the pressure of the enclosed gas.\n\n4.

Assume there is no change in temperature.\n\nLet's identify what we know:\nP₁ = 1.00 atm\nP₂ = 0.743 atm\nV₁ = 1.00 liter\nV₂ = ?\n\nWe'll use Boyle's Law and rearrange it to solve for V₂:\nV₂ = (P₁V₁)/P₂\nV₂ = (1.00 atm)(1.00 liter)/(0.743 atm)\nV₂ = 1.35 liters\n\nSo the balloon's volume would increase to 1.35 liters at the higher altitude.",

As the air inside the balloon expands, it is unable to stretch the fabric, which is not very elastic. Instead, the expanded air escapes out of a hole placed at the top of the balloon. How much air escapes?\n\nLet's think about this. We know:\nV₁ = 401,000 liters\nT₁ = 298 K\nT₂ = 398 K\n\nIf the balloon were elastic, the new volume would be:\nV₂ = V₁(T₂/T₁)\nV₂ = 401,000 liters × (398 K/298 K)\nV₂ = 401,000 liters × 1.336\nV₂ = 536,000 liters\n\nBut since the balloon can't expand, it stays at 401,000 liters, and the excess air escapes:\nAir escaped = 536,000 liters - 401,000 liters = 135,000 liters",
