Properties that describe the look or feel of a substance, such as color, hardness, density, texture, and phase, are called physical properties.

      "content": ": That's a really important question. The physical properties of a substance can change when conditions change, but that doesn't mean a different substance is created. Cooling liquid water to below 0°C causes the water to change to ice, but the substance is still water, no matter what the phase. The only difference is the orientation of the H₂O molecules and how rapidly they are moving.",

At 100°C, the atoms are farther apart, meaning that each milliliter now contains fewer atoms than at 25°C, and the density is now 13.4 grams per milliliter.

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's right. During a chemical change, there is a change in the way the atoms are chemically bonded to one another. A chemical bond is the force of attraction between two atoms that holds them together in a compound.",

For example, a methane molecule is made of a single carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms, and an oxygen molecule is made of two oxygen atoms bonded to each other. During the chemical change, the atoms in a methane molecule and those in two oxygen molecules first pull apart and then form new bonds with different partners, resulting in the formation of molecules of carbon dioxide and water.",

      "role": "assistant",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes, another interesting example occurs when an electric current passes through water. The energy of the current is sufficient to pull bonded atoms away from each other. Loose atoms then form new bonds with different atoms, which results in the formation of new molecules. Thus, water molecules are changed to molecules of hydrogen and oxygen, two substances that are very different from water.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Exactly! The hydrogen and oxygen are both gases at room temperature, and they can be seen as bubbles rising to the surface. In fact, the volume of hydrogen generated is twice that of oxygen, which tells us that each water molecule, H₂O, is made of twice as many hydrogen atoms as oxygen.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes! In the language of chemistry, materials undergoing a chemical change are said to be reacting. Methane reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water.

      "role": "assistant",

After a physical change, the molecules are the same as the ones you started with. After a chemical change, the original molecules no longer exist and new ones are in their place. In both cases there is a change in physical appearance.",

After all, we can't see the individual molecules.\n\nTwo powerful guidelines can help you distinguish between physical and chemical changes. First, in a physical change, a change in appearance is the result of a new set of conditions imposed on the same material. Restoring the original conditions restores the original appearance: frozen water melts upon warming.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Second, in a chemical change, a change in appearance is the result of the formation of a new material that has its own unique set of physical properties. The more evidence you have suggesting that a different material has been formed, the greater the likelihood that the change is a chemical change. Iron is a moldable metal that can be used to build cars. Rust is a reddish solid that readily falls apart. This suggests that the rusting of iron is a chemical change.",

In one scenario (A), the same molecules are just rearranged differently after a change. In another scenario (B), the original separate red atoms and blue atoms combine to form new molecules with red and blue atoms bonded together.

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Excellent analysis! In set A, the molecules before and after the change are the same. They differ only in their positions. Set A, therefore, represents only a physical change. In set B, new molecules, consisting of bonded red and blue spheres, appear after the change. These molecules represent a new material, so set B represents a chemical change.",
