We now know that alkaline ashes contain compounds of group 1 elements, most notably potassium carbonate, also known as potash.

Elements of group 17 are known as the halogens (\"salt-forming\" in Greek), because of their tendency to form various salts. Group 18 elements are all unreactive gases that tend not to combine with other elements. For this reason, they are called the inert noble gases, presumably because the nobility of earlier times were above interacting with common folk.",
