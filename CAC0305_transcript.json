By looking at the subscripts in the formula and using the periodic table, you can often deduce the charge on each atom in the compound.\n\nWhen no subscript is shown, it implies a subscript of one. So sodium chloride can be represented as Na1Cl1, showing sodium and chlorine bound in a 1:1 ratio.",

If you look at the periodic table, elements in group 1 (the far left column) tend to form a 1+ charge, while elements in group 17 (the second column from the right) tend to form a 1- charge. So for sodium chloride, the 1+ charge on sodium is balanced by the 1- charge on chlorine.\n\nLet's look at lithium oxide, Li2O. Lithium forms a 1+ charge, but we need two lithium atoms. Why? Because oxygen forms a 2- charge, so we need two 1+ lithium ions to balance that 2- charge.",

      "role": "assistant",

For example:\n- In NaCl, the subscript 1 for Na tells us Cl has a 1- charge\n- In MgCl2, the subscript 2 for Cl tells us Mg has a 2+ charge\n- In Li2O, the subscript 2 for Li tells us O has a 2- charge",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": You need to be careful there. Magnesium is in group 2 of the periodic table, so it forms a 2+ charge. When magnesium combines with oxygen, which has a 2- charge, we get Mg2+O2-. By convention, we reduce the subscripts to the lowest common denominator, so magnesium oxide is written as MgO instead of Mg2O2. It accurately tells us the ratio is 1:1, but it doesn't explicitly show that they each carry a double charge.\n\nThe key is to use the periodic table as a tool. Magnesium being in group 2 tells you it forms a 2+ ion.",

Iron, for example, can form either Fe2+ or Fe3+ ions depending on the conditions. This brings us to our next guideline.\n\nGuideline 3: Transition Metals. If the compound contains a transition metal, then Roman numerals are used to indicate the charge on the transition metal. \n\nFor example, iron(II) chloride has the formula FeCl2. The Roman numeral II explicitly tells us the charge on iron is 2+. Similarly, iron(III) chloride has the formula FeCl3, indicating iron has a 3+ charge.",
