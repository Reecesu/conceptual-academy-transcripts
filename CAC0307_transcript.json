A sample of water that is 99.9 percent pure has a greater proportion of impurities than does a sample of water that is 99.9999 percent pure.

One interesting feature of suspensions is that light shining through a suspension results in a visible cone as the light is reflected by the suspended components.

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes, a centrifuge is a device that spins at thousands of revolutions per minute. It separates the components of suspensions but not those of solutions. For example, blood, because it is a suspension, can be centrifuged into its components, which include the blood plasma (a yellowish solution) and white and red blood cells. The components of the plasma cannot be separated from one another because a centrifuge has no effect on solutions.",

What this means is that the sample contains 99.9999 grams of water, which is still nearly 3 × 10²⁴ water molecules. Pretty good, right? However, if the remaining 0.0001 grams were made of dissolved lead, Pb, then this would correspond to about 3 × 10¹⁷ (300,000 trillion) atoms of Pb, which is quite small compared to the number of water molecules but is still an amazingly large number.",
