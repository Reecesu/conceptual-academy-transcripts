As a practical application of his discoveries, Franklin invented the lightning rod - a sharp point of metal placed on a rooftop and connected to the ground by a long wire. Houses with these rods are protected from lightning strikes.",

This meant electrical energy could travel through different types of gases.\n\nWhat really surprised them, though, was that a ray was also produced when they applied voltage across a glass tube that had been evacuated of any gas. This implied that the ray wasn't simply the glowing of a contained gas but rather something entirely on its own.",

He reasoned that the deflection of the particles depended on their mass and electric charge. The greater a particle's mass, the greater its resistance to a change in motion, which would result in a smaller deflection. The greater a particle's charge, the stronger the magnetic interactions, which would result in a larger deflection.",

      "content": ": That's a perfect everyday comparison! Just as it's harder to change the direction of a heavy shopping cart than a light one, particles with greater mass resist changes to their motion more. Thomson concluded that the angle of deflection was proportional to the ratio of the particle's charge to its mass.",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's the problem Thomson faced! Knowing only the angle of deflection, he was unable to calculate either the charge or the mass of each particle. In order to calculate the mass, he needed to know the charge, but in order to calculate the charge, he needed to know the mass.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Exactly right! It's similar to an equation like 3 = x/y. You can't determine one specific value for x unless you know the value of y. In contrast, with an equation like 4 = x/2, you can determine that x = 8.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": No, they didn't give up! In 1909, the American physicist Robert Millikan designed an innovative experiment to solve this problem. He sprayed tiny oil droplets into a specially designed chamber. The droplets picked up a negative charge after passing through a hole in a charged plate.\n\nMillikan then reversed the charge on the plate so the droplets would be pulled upward. By adjusting the strength of the plate's charge, he could get droplets of various sizes to hover motionless. When this happened, the upward electric force exactly balanced the downward force of gravity.",

The electric charge on any droplet was always some multiple of a single very small value: 1.60 Ã— 10^-19 coulomb. Millikan proposed this to be the fundamental increment of all electric charge. The coulomb, by the way, is a unit of electric charge.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's an excellent analogy! Just as prices might be $0.05, $0.10, $0.15 - all multiples of $0.05 - Millikan found electric charges that were all multiples of this tiny fundamental charge. Think of numbers like 45, 30, 60, 75, 105, 35, 80, 55, 90, 20, and 65 - they're all multiples of 5. Similarly, the electric charges Millikan measured were all multiples of this fundamental unit.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes! Using this value for the charge and the charge-to-mass ratio discovered by Thomson, Millikan calculated the mass of a cathode ray particle. The result was startling - it had a mass considerably less than that of the smallest known atom, hydrogen. This was revolutionary because at that time, atoms were thought to be the smallest particles of matter. Here scientists had discovered a particle smaller than the smallest atom!",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": It absolutely was! This discovery completely changed our understanding of the fundamental nature of matter. The cathode ray particle is known today as the electron, a name that comes from the Greek word for amber (electrik), which is a material the early Greeks used to study the effects of static electricity.",

      "content": ": Yes, the electron is a fundamental component of all atoms. All electrons are identical, each having a negative electric charge and an incredibly small mass of 9.1 Ã— 10^-31 kilograms. The arrangement of electrons in atoms determines many of a material's properties, including chemical reactivity and physical attributes such as taste, texture, appearance, and color.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",

Most notably, the original television sets were cathode ray tubes with one end widened out into a phosphor-coated screen.
