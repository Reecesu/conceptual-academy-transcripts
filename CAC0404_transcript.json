Interestingly, about 1 percent of the carbon we consume in food is the carbon-13 isotope, containing seven neutrons per nucleus.

This is the atomic mass unit, abbreviated as amu; 1 atomic mass unit is equal to 1.661 × 10⁻²⁴ gram, which is slightly less than the mass of a single proton.

This small amount of carbon-13 raises the average mass of carbon from 12.000 atomic mass units to the slightly greater value 12.011 atomic mass units.\n\nTo arrive at the atomic mass presented in the periodic table, you first multiply the mass of each naturally occurring isotope of an element by the fraction of its abundance and then add up all the fractions.
