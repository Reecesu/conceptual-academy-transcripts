This is section 4.8 in your textbook about orbitals and energy-level diagrams.\n\nFirst, let's address the wave nature of electrons. Electrons don't behave like tiny billiard balls; they actually behave as waves in three dimensions.

It turns out that the intensity of the wave at any location determines the probability of finding the electron at that location.

As you noted, electrons naturally tend to occupy the lowest energy orbitals first.

For example, in the alkaline metals of group 1, like lithium, sodium, and potassium, the outermost occupied orbital is an s orbital containing a single electron.\n\nIn general, elements in the same group of the periodic table have similar electron configurations, which explains why elements in the same group have similar properties.",

Similarly, d orbitals first appear at n=3, and f orbitals at n=4.\n\nAs for why the 4s orbital has a lower energy than the 3d orbital despite having a higher quantum number—this has to do with the effects of electron shielding and penetration in multi-electron atoms.

Remember that the shell model, like all models in science, is a tool to help us understand and predict how atoms behave—it's not an actual representation of the atom's physical structure. Electrons aren't really confined to the surface of a shell.\n\nIn later chapters, we'll use an abbreviated version of this model, called the electron-dot structure, to show how atoms join together to form molecules. This knowledge of electron configurations and orbitals provides the foundation for understanding chemical bonding and many other aspects of chemistry.",
