That's why we find only two elements, hydrogen and helium, in the first period. Hydrogen is the element whose atoms have only one electron. This one electron resides within the first shell, which is the shell closest to the nucleus. Each helium atom has two electrons, both of which are also within the first shell, which is thus filled to its maximum capacity.

This diminished nuclear charge experienced by outer-shell electrons is called the effective nuclear charge and is abbreviated Z* (pronounced zee-star), where Z stands for the nuclear charge and the asterisk indicates that this charge appears to be less than it actually is.",

The ten electrons of the inner two shells shield each of the seven electrons of the third shell from the +17 nucleus. The third-shell electrons therefore experience an effective nuclear charge of about 17 - 10 = +7. In a potassium atom, the fourth-shell electron experiences an effective nuclear charge of about 19 - 18 = +1.",

Let's look at this trend from the point of view of effective nuclear charge.\n\nConsider lithium's outermost electron, which experiences an effective nuclear charge of about +1. Then look across period 2 to neon, in which each outermost electron experiences an effective nuclear charge of about +8. Because the outer-shell electrons in neon experience a greater attraction to the nucleus, they are pulled in closer to the nucleus. So, neon, although nearly three times as massive as lithium, has a considerably smaller diameter.",

There are some exceptions to this trend, especially between groups 12 and 13, but these exceptions can be explained by probing further into the shell model than we need to for our purposes.\n\nMoving down a group, atomic diameters get larger because of an increasing number of occupied shells. Whereas lithium has a small diameter because it has only two occupied shells, francium (atomic number 87) has a much larger diameter because it has seven occupied shells.",

In general, the trend is that the smaller the atom, the more tightly bound are its electrons.\n\nAs discussed earlier, effective nuclear charge increases in moving from left to right across any period. Thus, not only are atoms toward the right smaller, but their electrons are held more strongly. It takes about four times as much energy to remove an outer electron from a neon atom, for example, than to remove the outer electron from a lithium atom.",

Moving down any group, the effective nuclear chargeâ€”as calculated by subtracting the charge of inner-shell electrons from the charge of the nucleusâ€”stays the same. The effective nuclear charge for all group 1 elements, for example, works out to +1.\n\nBecause of their greater number of shells, however, elements toward the bottom of a group are larger. The electrons in the outermost shell are therefore farther from the nucleus by an appreciable distance. From physics we learn that the electric force weakens rapidly with increasing distance.\n\nAn outer-shell electron in a larger atom, such as cesium, is not held as tightly as an outer-shell electron in a smaller atom, such as lithium. As a consequence, the energy needed to remove the outer electron from a cesium atom is about half the energy needed to remove the outer electron from a lithium atom. This is true even though they both have a calculated Z* of +1. So, we see that our calculated Z* values provide only a rough estimate of the nuclear pull on electrons. The effect of distance between a shell and the nucleus also needs to be considered.",

The combination of the increasing effective nuclear charge from left to right and the increasing number of shells from top to bottom creates a periodic trend in which the electrons in atoms at the upper right of the periodic table are held most strongly and the electrons in atoms at the lower left are held least strongly.\n\nThis is reflected in what we call ionization energy, the amount of energy needed to pull an electron away from an atom.
