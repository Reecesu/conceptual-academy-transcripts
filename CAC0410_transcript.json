When a baseball is pitched, we can measure its speed by having it fly through a pair of photogates placed a known distance apart. The ball interrupts beams of light in these gates, which allows us to time how long it takes to travel between them.",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Exactly! In this setup, the accuracy of the ball's measured speed depends on how precisely we know the distance between the gates and how accurate our timing mechanisms are. The key point here is that the interaction between the macroscopic baseball and the photons of light it encounters during measurement is insignificant. The photons bouncing off the baseball don't noticeably change its motion.",

      "content": ": Let me explain. If you wish to observe an electron and determine its location with light, you face two problematic options. First, you could use light with a very short wavelength, which can \"see\" the tiny electron better because of the finer resolution. However, short wavelength light corresponds to a large quantum of energy, which greatly alters the electron's state of motion when it hits.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Precisely! Alternatively, if you use light with a longer wavelength that corresponds to a smaller quantum of energy, you'll disturb the electron less, but your measurement of its position will be less accurate because of the coarser wave. The act of probing something as tiny as an electron produces a considerable uncertainty in either its position or its motion.",

      "content": ": Yes, it does. Heisenberg found that when the uncertainties in the measurement of the momentum and position of a particle are multiplied, the product must be equal to or greater than Planck's constant, h, divided by 2π. The equation looks like this:\n\n(Δp)(Δx) ≥ h/2π\n\nWhere Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, Δx is the uncertainty in position, and the product must be equal to or greater than h/2π.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": In practice, it means there's a fundamental limit to how precisely we can know both position and momentum simultaneously. If we want to know the momentum of an electron with great accuracy (small Δp), the corresponding uncertainty in position (Δx) will be large. Or, if we want to know the position with great accuracy, the uncertainty in momentum will be large. The sharper one of these quantities is, the less sharp the other becomes.",

      "content": ": Exactly! The uncertainty principle is relevant only to quantum phenomena. The inaccuracies in measuring the position and momentum of a baseball due to quantum effects are completely negligible. But for an electron, these inaccuracies are far from negligible because the uncertainties in the measurements are comparable to the magnitude of the quantities themselves.",

Simply put, a transistor can hold information as either a 1 or a 0. A single transistor isn't impressive by itself, but billions of them working together in a tiny integrated circuit is remarkable.",

While there have been many advances in transistor technology over the past several decades, transistors face a fundamental limit when it comes to the speed at which they can operate. Most notably, because they are electronic circuits, they run on electricity, which necessarily means they get hot. The higher the speed, the hotter (and less efficient) they get.",
