There's radioactivity, which occurs naturally in the air we breathe, the rocks around us, and even in the food we eat. Some nuclear energy is controlled by humans and is used in medical diagnostics and radiation therapy. Nuclear power plants transform nuclear energy into electricity.

The neutrons and protons are at the highly dense center of each atom—its nucleus. Most atoms have stable nuclei, which means they hold together well. This stability is due to an optimal balance of the number of protons with the number of neutrons. These stable nuclei remain unchanged.",

They may either contain too many neutrons and not enough protons or vice versa. Sooner or later, these nuclei spontaneously change to a more stable composition. For example, excess neutrons may transform into protons to provide a better nuclear balance. During these transformations, the nucleus ejects highly energetic particles while also emitting highly energetic electromagnetic radiation.",

The high-energy particles and radiation emitted by a radioactive substance is called radioactivity. Notably, a radioactive nucleus disintegrates as it emits radioactivity. In other words, after emitting the radioactivity, the radioactive nucleus is no longer what it was. We say that the nucleus has \"decayed,\" which is why the process of emitting radioactivity is often called radioactive decay.",

An alpha particle is the combination of two protons and two neutrons—in other words, it is the nucleus of the helium atom, atomic number 2. Alpha particles are relatively easy to shield against because of their relatively large size and their double positive charge (+2). For example, they do not normally penetrate such lightweight materials as paper or clothing.",

When traveling through only a few centimeters of air, alpha particles pick up electrons and become nothing more than harmless helium. As a matter of fact, that's the origin of the helium in a child's balloon—practically all Earth's helium atoms were at one time energetic alpha particles.",

Beta particles are actually created within the nucleus during the decay process. We'll cover that mechanism when we get to Section 5.3. For now, just understand that beta particles are not the same as the orbital electrons.",

They can penetrate fairly deeply into skin, where they have the potential to harm or kill living cells, but they are unable to penetrate even thin sheets of denser materials, such as aluminum.

The amount of energy in a gamma ray, however, is much greater than that in visible light, ultraviolet light, or even X rays. Because they have no mass or electric charge, and because of their high energies, gamma rays are able to penetrate through most materials. However, they cannot easily penetrate very dense materials, such as lead.",

The shelf life of fresh strawberries and other perishables is markedly increased when the food is subjected to gamma rays from a radioactive source, which kills the microorganisms that normally lead to spoilage.

Let me pose a concept check question to see how well you understand this material: Pretend that you are given three radioactive rocks. One is an alpha emitter, one is a beta emitter, and one is a gamma emitter, and you know which is which. You can throw away one, but of the remaining two, you must hold one in your hand and place one in your pocket. What can you do to minimize your exposure to radiation?",

The alpha particles don't penetrate much, so holding that rock might be okay since my skin would stop most of it. And I guess I'd put the beta emitter in my pocket since my clothes might provide some protection? But honestly, I wouldn't want to be near any of them!",

Hold the alpha emitter in your hand because the skin on your hand is enough to shield you. Put the beta emitter in your pocket because beta particles will likely be stopped by the combined thickness of your clothing and skin.
