Actually, radioactivity has been around far longer than humans. It has always been in the soil we walk on and in the air that we breathe, and it even warms Earth's interior. In fact, radioactive decay in Earth's interior heats the water that spurts from a geyser or wells up from a natural hot spring.",

At sea level, the protective blanket of the atmosphere reduces this radiation, but radiation is more intense at higher altitudes, where the air is thinner. For example, in Denver, the \"Mile-High City,\" a person receives more than twice as much cosmic radiation as someone does at sea level.",

Fallout from nuclear testing and the coal and nuclear power industries are also contributors. Interestingly, the coal industry outranks the nuclear power industry as a source of radiation. The global combustion of coal annually releases about 13,000 tons of radioactive thorium and uranium into the atmosphere, in addition to other environmentally damaging molecules, including greenhouse gases.",

In addition, mutations that occur in an individual's reproductive cells can be passed to the individual's offspring.

Motor oil manufacturers can quantify the lubricating qualities of their products by running oil in engines containing small but measurable amounts of radioactive isotopes. As the engine runs and the pistons rub against the inner chambers, some of the metal from the engine invariably makes its way into the motor oil, and this metal carries with it the embedded radioactive isotopes. The better the lubricating qualities of a motor oil, the fewer radioactive isotopes it will contain after running in the engine for a given length of time.",

The tracer may be introduced alone or along with some other chemical, known as a carrier compound, that helps target the isotope to a particular type of tissue in the body. For example, the thyroid gland, located in the neck, absorbs much of the iodine that enters the body through food and drink. Images of the thyroid gland can be obtained by giving a patient the radioactive isotope iodine-131. These images are useful in diagnosing metabolic disorders.",

At a depth of merely 30 kilometers, the temperature is over 500°C. At greater depths, it is so hot that rock melts into magma, which can rise to the Earth's surface to escape as lava. The main reason it gets hotter down below is that the Earth contains an abundance of radioactive isotopes and is heated as it absorbs the radiation from these isotopes. So, volcanoes, geysers, and hot springs are all powered by radioactivity. Even the drifting of continents (plate tectonics) is a consequence of the Earth's internal radioactivity.",
