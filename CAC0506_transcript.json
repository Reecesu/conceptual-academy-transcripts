Most of the protons that are released are stopped as they collide with atoms in the upper atmosphere. When these protons collide, they strip electrons from the atoms and become hydrogen atoms. The neutrons, however, continue for longer distances because they have no electric charge and therefore don't interact electrically with matter. Eventually, many neutrons collide with atomic nuclei in the lower atmosphere.",

Both of these isotopes, for example, chemically react with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, which is consumed by plants through the process of photosynthesis.

In this way, a radioactive equilibrium is reached in which there is a constant ratio of about 1 carbon-14 atom to every 100 billion carbon-12 atoms.",

Then the percentage of carbon-14 decreases at a constant rate determined by its half-life. The amount of carbon-12, however, does not change, because this isotope does not undergo radioactive decay. The longer a plant or other organism is dead, the less carbon-14 it contains relative to the constant amount of carbon-12.",

      "role": "assistant",

Half of the remaining carbon-14 atoms will then decay in the following 5730 years, and so on.",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Exactly! With this knowledge, scientists are able to calculate the age of carbon-containing artifacts, such as wooden tools or ancient skeletons. Their age is measured by their current level of radioactivity. This process, known as carbon-14 dating, enables investigators to probe as far as 50,000 years into the past. Beyond this time span, there is too little carbon-14 remaining for accurate analysis.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's the basic idea! Let me give you a visual example. Imagine a skeleton that was once alive. When it was alive, it had a certain amount of carbon-14. After 5730 years, that amount would be reduced by half. After another 5730 years, the remaining amount would be reduced by half again. So today, a very old skeleton contains only a trace amount of the original carbon-14.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's an excellent question! Because of fluctuations in cosmic ray bombardment rates over the centuries, carbon dating has an uncertainty of about 15 percent. This means, for example, that the straw of an old adobe brick dated to be 500 years old may really be only 425 years old on the low side or 575 years old on the high side. For many purposes, this is an acceptable level of uncertainty.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",

Suppose that an archaeologist extracts 1 gram of carbon from an ancient ax handle and finds that it is one-fourth as radioactive as 1 gram of carbon extracted from a freshly cut tree branch. If we know that carbon-14 reduces by half every 5730 years, we can calculate the age.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Let's think about it. After one half-life, the radioactivity would be 1/2 of the original. After two half-lives, it would be 1/4 of the original. So if the ax handle is one-fourth as radioactive as a fresh sample, it has gone through two half-lives.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's correct! Assuming the ratio of C-14/C-12 was the same when the ax was made, the ax handle is as old as two half-lives of C-14, or about 11,460 years old.",

Rocks dated in this manner have been found to be as much as 3.7 billion years old. Samples from the Moon have been dated at 4.2 billion years, which is close to the estimated age of our solar system: 4.6 billion years.",
