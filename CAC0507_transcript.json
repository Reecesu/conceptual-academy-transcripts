      "role": "assistant",

Any chunk at or above the critical mass produces a steady release of energy. With the correct engineering, this release of energy can be controlled, which is what happens within a nuclear power plant. A different sort of engineering produces an explosion of energy, which is the basis of a nuclear fission bomb.",

Separation is difficult because, except for their slightly different masses, the two isotopes have the same physical and chemical properties. Scientists took more than 2 years to extract enough of the 235 isotope from uranium ore to make the bomb that was detonated at Hiroshima in 1945. To this day, uranium isotope separation, also known as uranium enrichment, remains a difficult process.",

Because the U-235 isotopes are so highly diluted with U-238, an explosion like that of a nuclear bomb is not possible. The reaction rate, which depends on the number of neutrons that initiate the fission of other U-235 nuclei, is controlled by rods inserted into the reactor.

They are radioactive, most with very short half-lives, but some with half-lives of thousands of years.
