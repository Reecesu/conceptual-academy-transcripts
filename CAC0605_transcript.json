This star-sized diamond measures about 4000 kilometers wide, which amounts to about 10 billion trillion trillion carats. It has been named \"Lucy,\" after The Beatles song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\" In about 7 billion years, our own star, the Sun, is also likely to crystallize into a huge diamond ball.",

The nitrogen of the ammonium ion has four bonds and no lone pairs. This happens because the lone pair of ammonia reacted with a hydrogen ion to form the fourth bond.\n\nSimilarly, a negatively charged atom within a polyatomic ion has one fewer covalent bond and one additional lone pair compared to its neutral state. For example, the oxygen of a water molecule (H₂O) has two bonds and two lone pairs. If you remove a hydrogen ion (H⁺) from a water molecule, you create the hydroxide ion (OH⁻).
