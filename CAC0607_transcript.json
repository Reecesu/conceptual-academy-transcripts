In this case, the electrons are shared evenly between them.\n\nWe can represent these electrons using an electron-dot structure with the electrons positioned exactly halfway between the two atomic symbols. Alternatively, we can draw a cloud showing the positions of the bonding electrons over time as a series of dots. The electrons have the highest probability of being found where the dots are most concentrated.",

In a covalent bond between nonidentical atoms, the nuclear charges are different, and consequently, the bonding electrons may be shared unevenly.\n\nFor example, in a hydrogen-fluorine bond, the electrons are more attracted to fluorine's greater nuclear charge. The bonding electrons spend more time around the fluorine atom.",

      "content": ": That's a great way to put it! Because of this uneven sharing, the fluorine side of the bond becomes slightly negative, and since the bonding electrons have been drawn away from the hydrogen atom, the hydrogen side becomes slightly positive.\n\nThis separation of charges is called a dipole, pronounced \"die-pole.\" We represent this either with the characters ∂− and ∂+ (read as \"slightly negative\" and \"slightly positive,\" respectively) or by a crossed arrow pointing to the negative side of the bond.",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's an excellent analogy! Atoms forming a chemical bond do engage in a tug-of-war for electrons. How strongly an atom can tug on bonding electrons has been measured experimentally and quantified as the atom's electronegativity.\n\nThe range of electronegativities runs from 0.7 to 3.98. The greater an atom's electronegativity, the greater its ability to pull electrons toward itself when bonded. This is why in hydrogen fluoride, fluorine has a greater electronegativity, or pulling power, than hydrogen.",

When the two atoms in a covalent bond have the same electronegativity, no dipole is formed (as is the case with H₂), and the bond is classified as a nonpolar bond.\n\nWhen the electronegativities of the atoms differ, a dipole may form (as with HF), and the bond is classified as a polar bond. The degree of polarity depends on the difference between the electronegativity values of the two atoms—the greater the difference, the more polar the bond.",

As can be seen in the periodic table, the greater the distance between two atoms in the periodic table, the greater the difference in their electronegativities, and hence the greater the polarity of the bond between them.\n\nSo, a chemist can predict which bonds are more polar than others without memorizing all the electronegativities. Bond polarity can usually be inferred by looking at the relative positions of the atoms in the periodic table—the farther apart they are, especially when one is at the lower left and one is at the upper right, the greater the polarity of the bond between them.",

The magnitude of bond polarity is sometimes indicated by the size of the crossed arrow or the ∂− and ∂+ symbols used to depict a dipole.\n\nIt's worth noting that the electronegativity difference between atoms in an ionic bond is relatively large.

Rather, there is a gradual change from one to the other as the atoms that bond are located farther and farther apart in the periodic table.\n\nAtoms on opposite sides of the periodic table have great differences in electronegativity, and hence the bonds between them are highly polar—in other words, ionic. Nonmetallic atoms of the same element have the same electronegativities, so their bonds are nonpolar covalent.\n\nThe polar covalent bond, with its uneven sharing of electrons and slightly charged atoms, lies between these two extremes.",
