    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Let's start with the basics. When all the bonds in a molecule are nonpolar, the molecule as a whole is also nonpolar—as is the case with H₂, O₂, and N₂. When a molecule consists of only two atoms and the bond between them is polar, the polarity of the molecule is the same as the polarity of the bond—as with HF and HCl.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": You've identified an important point. Complexities do arise when assessing the polarity of a molecule containing more than two atoms. Let's consider carbon dioxide, CO₂, as an example.\n\nIn CO₂, the cause of the dipole in either of the carbon–oxygen bonds is oxygen's greater pull on the bonding electrons because oxygen is more electronegative than carbon. At the same time, however, the oxygen atom on the opposite side of the carbon pulls those electrons back to the carbon.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's an excellent way to think about it! The net result is an even distribution of bonding electrons around the entire molecule. Dipoles that are of equal strength but pull in opposite directions in a molecule effectively cancel each other, with the result that the molecule as a whole is nonpolar.\n\nIt's analogous to two people in a tug-of-war. As long as they pull with equal force but in opposite directions, the rope remains stationary.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Precisely! Let's look at another example: boron trifluoride, BF₃. In this molecule, three fluorine atoms are oriented 120° from one another around a central boron atom. Because the angles are all the same and because each fluorine atom pulls on the electrons of its boron–fluorine bond with the same force, the resulting polarity of this molecule is zero.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Exactly! This is analogous to three people pulling with equal force on ropes attached to a central ring. As long as they all pull with equal force and all maintain the 120° angles, the ring will remain stationary.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's an excellent question! It absolutely matters. Nonpolar molecules have only relatively weak attractions to other nonpolar molecules. This lack of attraction between nonpolar molecules explains the low boiling points of many nonpolar substances.",

      "feedback": null

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes! Recall that boiling is a process wherein the molecules of a liquid separate from one another as they go into the gaseous phase. When there are only weak attractions between the molecules of a liquid, less heat energy is required to liberate the molecules from one another and allow them to enter the gaseous phase.\n\nThis translates into a relatively low boiling point for the liquid. For example, nitrogen (N₂) has a very low boiling point of –196°C. The boiling points of hydrogen (H₂), oxygen (O₂), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and boron trifluoride (BF₃) are also quite low for the same reason.",

    {

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes, they do! But before we get to that, I should mention that polar interactions between molecules are many times weaker than the attractions between ions within an ionic bond. The polar attractions and the ionic bonds are both electrical attractions. The main difference between them is one of magnitude.\n\nNow, let's explore when molecules become polar. There are many instances in which the dipoles of different bonds in a molecule do not cancel each other.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's a great way to visualize it! Reconsider the rope analogy we discussed with the BF₃ molecule. As long as everyone pulls equally, the ring stays put. Imagine, however, that one person begins to ease off on the rope. Now the pulls are no longer balanced, and the ring begins to move away from the person who is slacking off. Likewise, if one person began to pull harder, the ring would move away from the other two people.",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Correct! A similar situation occurs in molecules in which polar covalent bonds are not equal and opposite. Perhaps the most relevant example is water, H₂O. Each hydrogen–oxygen covalent bond has a relatively large dipole because of the great electronegativity difference. Because of the bent shape of the molecule, however, the two dipoles do not cancel each other the way the C–O dipoles in CO₂ do.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Indeed! In water, the dipoles work together to give an overall dipole for the molecule. The region around the oxygen atom is therefore slightly negative, and the region around the two hydrogen atoms is slightly positive.",

    },
    {
      "role": "user",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": ": Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think... The one on the left looks more symmetrical, so maybe it's nonpolar? And the one on the right looks more uneven, so it might be polar?",
      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's excellent reasoning! Symmetry is often the greatest clue for determining polarity. Because the molecule on the left is symmetrical, the dipoles on the two sides cancel each other. This molecule is therefore nonpolar.\n\nBecause the molecule on the right is less symmetrical (more \"lopsided\"), it is a polar molecule.",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "user",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's a good rule of thumb, though we always need to consider the specific bonds and electronegativity differences. Now, let's discuss how polarity affects molecular interactions.\n\nPolar molecules electrically attract one another and, as a result, are relatively difficult to separate. In other words, polar molecules can be thought of as being \"sticky,\" which is why it takes more energy to separate them—to change the substance's phase.",
      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": ": So that's why some liquids boil at much higher temperatures than others?",
      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Exactly! For this reason, substances composed of polar molecules typically have higher boiling points than substances composed of nonpolar molecules. Water, for example, boils at 100°C, whereas carbon dioxide boils at –79°C. This 179°C difference is quite dramatic when you consider that a carbon dioxide molecule is more than twice as massive as a water molecule.",

    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": ": Wow, that is a big difference! I've never thought about why water boils at the temperature it does. It's interesting that it's because the molecules are \"sticky.\"",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes, water molecules attract one another because each contains a slightly positive side and a slightly negative side. The molecules position themselves in such a way that the positive side of one faces the negative side of a neighbor.",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's a great connection! Because molecular \"stickiness\" can play a lead role in determining a substance's macroscopic properties, molecular polarity is a central concept of chemistry.\n\nIt's not, however, that oil and water repel each other. Rather, water molecules are so attracted to themselves because of their polarity that they pull themselves together. The nonpolar oil molecules are thus excluded and left to themselves.",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Precisely! We see this in a bottle of oil and vinegar salad dressing. After the bottle is shaken vigorously, the water molecules of the vinegar cling together, excluding the oil molecules, which separate into their own layer. Being less dense than water, the oil rises to the top.\n\nThe same principle was sadly evident in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico—the largest accidental oil spill in human history. The oil came from a seafloor oil gusher that released an estimated 53,000 barrels every day for three months before it was finally capped. Petroleum-based oil molecules are not able to compete with the attraction water molecules have for themselves, which is why the oil and water don't mix.",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": It shows how understanding molecular concepts can help us understand large-scale phenomena in our world. The shape of a molecule, as determined by VSEPR, plays a major role in determining the polarity of that molecule. A molecule's polarity, in turn, has a great influence on macroscopic behavior.",

      "content": ": Yes, it all connects! Consider what the world would be like if the oxygen atom in a water molecule did not have its two nonbonding pairs of electrons. Instead of being bent, each water molecule would be linear, much like carbon dioxide.
