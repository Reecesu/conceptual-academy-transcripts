If you mix 150 grams of sucrose in 100 milliliters of water at 20°C, you'll produce an unsaturated solution - meaning more sugar could still dissolve. If you mix 200 grams of sucrose in 100 milliliters of water at 20°C, you'll produce a saturated solution.

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Interestingly, it's fairly easy to produce a supersaturated solution of sugar (sucrose) in water. For sugar, the point of saturation is highly dependent upon the temperature. Consider that while about 200 g of sucrose can dissolve in 100 mL of water at 20°C, at a higher temperature of about 100°C, it's possible to dissolve almost 500 g in 100 mL of water.",

Then you let the hot saturated solution slowly cool down. As it does, the extra sugar solute will remain in solution even after the solution has cooled—you'll have a supersaturated solution. Eventually, that extra sugar will come out of solution in the form of crystals, which is how rock candy (crystals of sugar) is made—add a bit of food coloring for further appeal.",
