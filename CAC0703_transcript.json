Let's start with the fundamental idea: the quantity of solute dissolved in a solution is described in mathematical terms by the solution's concentration, which is the amount of solute dissolved per amount of solution:\n\nConcentration = Amount of solute / Amount of solution\n\nDoes that formula make sense as a starting point?",

A sucrose-water solution containing 2 grams of sucrose per liter of solution is more concentrated, while one containing only 0.5 gram of sucrose per liter of solution is less concentrated, or what we call more dilute.",

But submicroscopic particles are so small that the number of them in any observable sample is incredibly large. To avoid awkwardly large numbers, scientists use a unit called the mole. One mole of any type of particle is equal to 6.02 × 10²³ particles.",

Thus, because 342 grams of sucrose contains 6.02 × 10²³ molecules of sucrose, we can use our shorthand wording and say that 342 grams of sucrose contains 1 mole of sucrose.",

This would be a concentration of 1 mole of sucrose per liter of solution. While the number of grams tells you the mass of solute in a given solution, the number of moles indicates the actual number of molecules.\n\nA common unit of concentration used by chemists is molarity, which is the solution's concentration expressed in moles of solute per liter of solution:\n\nMolarity = Moles of solute / Liters of solution\n\nA solution that contains 1 mole of solute per liter of solution is a 1-molar solution, which is often abbreviated 1 M.

Which is the solvent: sucrose or water?\n\nThere are 3.5 × 10²³ molecules of sucrose in 200 grams of sucrose, but there are almost 10 times as many molecules of water in 100 grams of water—3.3 × 10²⁴ molecules. \n\nAs we learned earlier, the solvent is the component present in the largest amount, but what do we mean by amount?

The correct answer is that you need 0.167 L (or about 0.17 L) of the 6.0 M solution.\n\nTo make your diluted solution, you would add 0.167 liters of 6.0 M HCl to a beaker that you then fill with water to the 0.50 liter mark.

If you add water to the HCl, the HCl gets hot, which is not good! Far better to add the HCl to the water so that the water absorbs this heat.\n\nSo, to make your dilution, you would first add a good portion of the water to the beaker, then carefully pour in the 0.167 liters of 6 M HCl.
