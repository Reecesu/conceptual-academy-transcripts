            <div class="content" id="content-2"><p>That's completely understandable! Many students find chemistry challenging at first, but I think you'll find solubility is a concept that connects well to everyday experiences. Let's start with the basics: solubility is simply a solute's ability to dissolve in a solvent. This primarily depends on the attractions between the fundamental particles of the solute and solvent. If a solute has any appreciable ability to dissolve in a solvent, we say it's soluble in that solvent.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-4"><p>Yes, but there's more to it. Solubility also depends on the attractions between solute particles themselves and between solvent particles themselves. Let me give you an example with sucrose, or table sugar. Sucrose molecules have many polar hydrogen-oxygen bonds, which allow them to form multiple hydrogen bonds with each other. These hydrogen bonds are strong enough to make sucrose a solid at room temperature with a relatively high melting point of 185°C.</p></div>

For sucrose to dissolve in water, the water molecules must first pull sucrose molecules away from one another. This does put a limit on how much sucrose can dissolve in water. Eventually, we reach a point where there aren't enough water molecules to separate the sucrose molecules from one another. This is what we call the point of saturation, which we discussed earlier - any additional sucrose added to the solution won't dissolve.</p></div>

Now, when the attractions among solute molecules are comparable to those among solvent molecules, there may not be a practical point of saturation. For example, the hydrogen bonds among water molecules are about as strong as those between ethanol molecules. These two liquids therefore mix together quite well in just about any proportion. We can even add so much ethanol to water that the ethanol, rather than water, becomes the solvent.</p></div>

Oxygen, O₂, is an example. In contrast to sucrose, which has a solubility of 200 grams per 100 milliliters of water, only 0.004 gram of oxygen can dissolve in 100 milliliters of water.</p><br><p>We can explain oxygen's low solubility in water by noting that the only attractions between oxygen molecules and water molecules are relatively weak dipole-induced dipole attractions. More importantly, the stronger attraction of water molecules for one another—through hydrogen bonds—effectively excludes oxygen molecules from intermingling with them.</p></div>

Also, although Styrofoam™ is insoluble in water, it's partially soluble in acetone, a solvent used in fingernail-polish remover.

Although the solubilities of many solid solutes—like sucrose—are greatly increased by rises in temperature, the solubilities of other solid solutes, such as sodium chloride (table salt), are only mildly affected by temperature. This difference involves various factors, including the strength of the chemical bonds in the solute molecules and how those molecules are packed together.</p><br><p>Interestingly, some chemicals, such as calcium carbonate (CaCO₃), actually become less soluble as water temperature increases.

As we cool this solution, the solubility of NaNO₃ decreases, and this change in solubility causes some of the dissolved NaNO₃ to precipitate. At 20°C, the solubility of NaNO₃ is only 87 grams per 100 milliliters of water. So, if we cool the 100°C solution to 20°C, 78 grams (165 grams – 87 grams) precipitates.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-24"><p>Great question! Yes, temperature can impact not only how much solute a solution can hold but also the rate at which the solute dissolves. At warmer temperatures, the solvent molecules have greater kinetic energy, allowing them to "attack" the solute more quickly. That's why sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in cold iced tea.</p><br><p>The surface area of the solute also matters. A large crystal of sugar takes longer to dissolve in water than the same mass of sugar crushed up into a fine powder. When you drop a large sugar crystal into water, only the surface of the crystal is exposed to water molecules. But if you grind that crystal into a powder before adding it to water, there's greater exposure of the sugar molecules to the water—we say the surface area of the sugar has been increased. Thus, the greater the surface area of the solute, the quicker it will dissolve.</p></div>

Right along the surface, solute molecules are going into solution, making that area fairly concentrated.

In contrast to the solubilities of most solids, the solubilities of gases in liquids decrease with increasing temperature. This occurs because with an increase in temperature, the solvent molecules have more kinetic energy, making it more difficult for a gaseous solute to remain in solution. The solute molecules are literally ejected by the high-energy solvent molecules.</p><br><p>As you've noticed, compared to cold carbonated beverages, warm ones go flat faster because the higher temperature causes the carbon dioxide gas molecules to leave the liquid solvent at a higher rate.</p></div>

In general, a higher gas pressure above the liquid means more of the gas dissolves.</p><br><p>A gas at high pressure has many gas particles crammed into a given volume. The "empty" space in an unopened soft drink bottle, for example, is crammed with carbon dioxide molecules in the gaseous phase.

Alternatively, we might say that the great pressure forces the carbon dioxide molecules into solution.</p><br><p>When the bottle is opened, the "head" of highly pressurized carbon dioxide gas escapes.

            <div class="content" id="content-34"><p>Great insight! Yes, when salt is added to water, it affects the solubility of all gases. Consider what happens when sodium and chloride ions are introduced: water molecules are drawn to these highly charged ions, surrounding them and forming a "sphere of hydration." This means fewer water molecules are available to interact with nonpolar gas molecules like oxygen (O₂) or carbon dioxide (CO₂).</p><br><p>Simply put, these gas molecules cannot compete with the salt for water's attention. As salt is introduced to water, the solubility of any gas dissolved in that water decreases. This is called a salting effect.</p><br><p>This explains why adding salt to a carbonated beverage is particularly effective at forming bubbles—you get both the nucleation sites we discussed earlier and this salting effect. It also explains why oxygen is more soluble in freshwater streams and lakes than in seawater. A freshwater trout won't survive in seawater partly because its tissues aren't accustomed to the high salinity, but also because there's less oxygen available for it to absorb through its gills.</p></div>

For example, consider the reaction between lead nitrate, Pb(NO₃)₂, and potassium iodide, KI, to form lead iodide, PbI₂, and potassium nitrate, KNO₃:</p><br><p>Pb(NO₃)₂ + 2 KI → PbI₂ + 2 KNO₃</p><br><p>What happens is that the iodine (I) jumps from the potassium (K) to the lead (Pb) to form lead iodide (PbI₂). Both reactants—lead nitrate and potassium iodide—are soluble in water, which is why this reaction can be performed in an aqueous solution (water as the solvent). We can indicate this by placing (aq) after each water-soluble compound:</p><br><p>Pb(NO₃)₂(aq) + 2 KI(aq) → PbI₂(s) + 2 KNO₃(aq)</p><br><p>While lead nitrate, potassium iodide, and the potassium nitrate product are all soluble in cold water, the lead iodide product is not.

They're not meant to be memorized but are provided as a reference. Some of them are:</p><br><p>1. Salts containing Group I ions (Li⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, Cs⁺, Rb⁺) are soluble, with few exceptions. Salts containing the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺) are also soluble.</p><br><p>2. Salts containing nitrate ion (NO₃⁻) are generally soluble.</p><br><p>3. Salts containing Group 17 ions (Cl⁻, Br⁻, or I⁻) are generally soluble. Important exceptions are halide salts of Ag⁺, Pb²⁺, and Hg₂²⁺. Thus, AgCl, PbBr₂, and Hg₂Cl₂ are insoluble.</p><br><p>4. Most silver salts are insoluble. AgNO₃ and Ag(C₂H₃O₂) are common soluble silver salts; virtually all others are insoluble.</p><br><p>5. Most sulfate salts are soluble. Important exceptions include CaSO₄, BaSO₄, PbSO₄, Ag₂SO₄, and SrSO₄.</p><br><p>6. Most hydroxide salts are only slightly soluble. Hydroxide salts of Group I ions are soluble. Hydroxide salts of Group II ions (Ca, Sr, and Ba) are slightly soluble. Hydroxide salts of transition metals and Al³⁺ are insoluble. Thus, Fe(OH)₃, Al(OH)₃, Co(OH)₂ are not soluble.</p><br><p>7. Most sulfides of transition metals are highly insoluble, including CdS, FeS, ZnS, and Ag₂S. Arsenic, antimony, bismuth, and lead sulfides are also insoluble.</p><br><p>8. Carbonates are frequently insoluble. Group II carbonates (CaCO₃, SrCO₃, and BaCO₃) are insoluble, as are FeCO₃ and PbCO₃.</p><br><p>9. Chromates are frequently insoluble. Examples include PbCrO₄ and BaCrO₄.</p><br><p>10. Phosphates such as Ca₃(PO₄)₂ and Ag₃PO₄ are frequently insoluble.</p><br><p>11. Fluorides such as BaF₂, MgF₂, and PbF₂ are frequently insoluble.</p></div>

I'm Alia, and I'm here to support the learning of core science concepts. Let's get started. How can I help you today?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Hi Alia. I need to understand solubility for my science class. I've always struggled with chemistry concepts, so I'm a bit nervous about this topic.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's completely understandable! Many students find chemistry challenging at first, but I think you'll find solubility is a concept that connects well to everyday experiences. Let's start with the basics: solubility is simply a solute's ability to dissolve in a solvent. This primarily depends on the attractions between the fundamental particles of the solute and solvent. If a solute has any appreciable ability to dissolve in a solvent, we say it's soluble in that solvent.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So solubility is just about whether something can dissolve in something else? That seems straightforward enough.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, but there's more to it. Solubility also depends on the attractions between solute particles themselves and between solvent particles themselves. Let me give you an example with sucrose, or table sugar. Sucrose molecules have many polar hydrogen-oxygen bonds, which allow them to form multiple hydrogen bonds with each other. These hydrogen bonds are strong enough to make sucrose a solid at room temperature with a relatively high melting point of 185\u00b0C.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wait, I'm confused. If sugar molecules are strongly attracted to each other, wouldn't that make sugar less likely to dissolve in water?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's an excellent observation! You're absolutely right. For sucrose to dissolve in water, the water molecules must first pull sucrose molecules away from one another. This does put a limit on how much sucrose can dissolve in water. Eventually, we reach a point where there aren't enough water molecules to separate the sucrose molecules from one another. This is what we call the point of saturation, which we discussed earlier - any additional sucrose added to the solution won't dissolve.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Oh, I get it now. So that's why when I add too much sugar to my iced tea, it just sinks to the bottom!", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Exactly! That's a perfect everyday example. Now, when the attractions among solute molecules are comparable to those among solvent molecules, there may not be a practical point of saturation. For example, the hydrogen bonds among water molecules are about as strong as those between ethanol molecules. These two liquids therefore mix together quite well in just about any proportion. We can even add so much ethanol to water that the ethanol, rather than water, becomes the solvent.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So ethanol and water mix really well together. Is that why alcoholic beverages can be so concentrated?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, that's part of it! When a solute has no practical point of saturation in a given solvent, we say it's infinitely soluble in that solvent. Ethanol is infinitely soluble in water. Similarly, all gases are generally infinitely soluble in other gases because they can be mixed together in just about any proportion.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": But not all things dissolve well in water, right? Like oil doesn't mix with water.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's correct. Let's look at the other extreme of solubility, where a solute has very little solubility in a given solvent. Oxygen, O\u2082, is an example. In contrast to sucrose, which has a solubility of 200 grams per 100 milliliters of water, only 0.004 gram of oxygen can dissolve in 100 milliliters of water.\n\nWe can explain oxygen's low solubility in water by noting that the only attractions between oxygen molecules and water molecules are relatively weak dipole-induced dipole attractions. More importantly, the stronger attraction of water molecules for one another\u2014through hydrogen bonds\u2014effectively excludes oxygen molecules from intermingling with them.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So the water molecules prefer to stick with each other rather than interact with the oxygen?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a great way to put it! A material that doesn't dissolve in a solvent to any appreciable extent is said to be insoluble in that solvent. Many substances are insoluble in water, including sand and glass. But just because a material is not soluble in one solvent doesn't mean it won't dissolve in another.\n\nFor example, sand and glass are soluble in hydrofluoric acid, HF, which is used to give glass a decorative frosted look. Also, although Styrofoam\u2122 is insoluble in water, it's partially soluble in acetone, a solvent used in fingernail-polish remover. If you pour a little acetone into a Styrofoam\u2122 cup, the acetone soon causes the Styrofoam\u2122 to deform.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's interesting! I've actually seen that happen before when someone put nail polish remover in a Styrofoam cup - it started dissolving. I thought it was melting, but it was actually dissolving?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Exactly! That's an excellent observation. Now, let's talk about how solubility changes with temperature. You've probably noticed from experience that water-soluble solids usually dissolve better in hot water than in cold water.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Yeah, like when making tea or hot chocolate, the sugar dissolves much faster in hot water.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a perfect example! A highly concentrated solution of sucrose in water can be made by heating the solution almost to the boiling point. This is how syrup and hard candy are made.\n\nSolubility increases with increasing temperature because hot water molecules have greater kinetic energy and therefore are able to collide with the solid solute more vigorously. These vigorous collisions facilitate the disruption of particle-to-particle attractions in the solid.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Does that mean all solids dissolve better in hot water?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Not necessarily. Although the solubilities of many solid solutes\u2014like sucrose\u2014are greatly increased by rises in temperature, the solubilities of other solid solutes, such as sodium chloride (table salt), are only mildly affected by temperature. This difference involves various factors, including the strength of the chemical bonds in the solute molecules and how those molecules are packed together.\n\nInterestingly, some chemicals, such as calcium carbonate (CaCO\u2083), actually become less soluble as water temperature increases. This explains why the inner surfaces of tea kettles are often coated with calcium carbonate residues.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's fascinating! I've always wondered what that white stuff inside my kettle was. So what happens when a hot solution cools down?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": When a sugar solution saturated at a high temperature is allowed to cool, some of the sugar usually comes out of solution and forms what is called a precipitate. When this occurs, the solute, sugar in this case, is said to have precipitated from the solution.\n\nLet's consider a quantitative example: At 100\u00b0C, the solubility of sodium nitrate, NaNO\u2083, in water is 165 grams per 100 milliliters of water. As we cool this solution, the solubility of NaNO\u2083 decreases, and this change in solubility causes some of the dissolved NaNO\u2083 to precipitate. At 20\u00b0C, the solubility of NaNO\u2083 is only 87 grams per 100 milliliters of water. So, if we cool the 100\u00b0C solution to 20\u00b0C, 78 grams (165 grams \u2013 87 grams) precipitates.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That makes sense. Are there other factors besides temperature that affect how quickly something dissolves?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Great question! Yes, temperature can impact not only how much solute a solution can hold but also the rate at which the solute dissolves. At warmer temperatures, the solvent molecules have greater kinetic energy, allowing them to \"attack\" the solute more quickly. That's why sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in cold iced tea.\n\nThe surface area of the solute also matters. A large crystal of sugar takes longer to dissolve in water than the same mass of sugar crushed up into a fine powder. When you drop a large sugar crystal into water, only the surface of the crystal is exposed to water molecules. But if you grind that crystal into a powder before adding it to water, there's greater exposure of the sugar molecules to the water\u2014we say the surface area of the sugar has been increased. Thus, the greater the surface area of the solute, the quicker it will dissolve.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That makes a lot of sense! Is that why recipes sometimes call for powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, exactly! There's one more factor to consider: what happens right at the surface of the solute where molecules are dissolving. Right along the surface, solute molecules are going into solution, making that area fairly concentrated. This means 1) the solution might be saturated at that location, and 2) the number of water molecules is getting less. Both factors can be overcome by stirring the solution, providing agitation to ensure movement of both the solvent and solute.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I've noticed gases seem to behave differently in solution. Like soda goes flat faster when it's warm. Why is that?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": You've made an excellent observation! In contrast to the solubilities of most solids, the solubilities of gases in liquids decrease with increasing temperature. This occurs because with an increase in temperature, the solvent molecules have more kinetic energy, making it more difficult for a gaseous solute to remain in solution. The solute molecules are literally ejected by the high-energy solvent molecules.\n\nAs you've noticed, compared to cold carbonated beverages, warm ones go flat faster because the higher temperature causes the carbon dioxide gas molecules to leave the liquid solvent at a higher rate.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Does pressure also affect how gases dissolve?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Absolutely! The solubility of a gas in a liquid also depends on the pressure of the gas immediately above the liquid. In general, a higher gas pressure above the liquid means more of the gas dissolves.\n\nA gas at high pressure has many gas particles crammed into a given volume. The \"empty\" space in an unopened soft drink bottle, for example, is crammed with carbon dioxide molecules in the gaseous phase. With nowhere else to go, many of these molecules dissolve in the liquid. Alternatively, we might say that the great pressure forces the carbon dioxide molecules into solution.\n\nWhen the bottle is opened, the \"head\" of highly pressurized carbon dioxide gas escapes. Now the gas pressure above the liquid is lower than before. As a result, the solubility of the carbon dioxide drops, and the carbon dioxide molecules that were once squeezed into the solution begin to escape into the air above the liquid.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Is that why shaking a soda before opening it makes it explode? I learned that the hard way!", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes! The rate at which carbon dioxide molecules leave an opened soft drink is relatively slow. You can increase this rate by adding granulated sugar, salt, or sand. The microscopic nooks and crannies on the surfaces of these grains serve as nucleation sites where carbon dioxide bubbles can form rapidly and then escape by buoyant forces.\n\nShaking the beverage increases the surface area of the liquid-to-gas interface, making it easier for the carbon dioxide to escape from the solution. Once shaken, the rate at which carbon dioxide escapes becomes so great that the beverage froths over. \n\nYou also increase the rate of carbon dioxide escape when you pour the beverage into your mouth, which has many nucleation sites. That's why you feel that tingly sensation!", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That explains why adding salt to soda makes it fizz more! Does adding salt to water affect other gases too?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Great insight! Yes, when salt is added to water, it affects the solubility of all gases. Consider what happens when sodium and chloride ions are introduced: water molecules are drawn to these highly charged ions, surrounding them and forming a \"sphere of hydration.\" This means fewer water molecules are available to interact with nonpolar gas molecules like oxygen (O\u2082) or carbon dioxide (CO\u2082).\n\nSimply put, these gas molecules cannot compete with the salt for water's attention. As salt is introduced to water, the solubility of any gas dissolved in that water decreases. This is called a salting effect.\n\nThis explains why adding salt to a carbonated beverage is particularly effective at forming bubbles\u2014you get both the nucleation sites we discussed earlier and this salting effect. It also explains why oxygen is more soluble in freshwater streams and lakes than in seawater. A freshwater trout won't survive in seawater partly because its tissues aren't accustomed to the high salinity, but also because there's less oxygen available for it to absorb through its gills.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wow, I never made that connection about fish!

During a chemical reaction, atoms change partners to form new compounds. For example, consider the reaction between lead nitrate, Pb(NO\u2083)\u2082, and potassium iodide, KI, to form lead iodide, PbI\u2082, and potassium nitrate, KNO\u2083:\n\nPb(NO\u2083)\u2082 + 2 KI \u2192 PbI\u2082 + 2 KNO\u2083\n\nWhat happens is that the iodine (I) jumps from the potassium (K) to the lead (Pb) to form lead iodide (PbI\u2082). Both reactants\u2014lead nitrate and potassium iodide\u2014are soluble in water, which is why this reaction can be performed in an aqueous solution (water as the solvent). We can indicate this by placing (aq) after each water-soluble compound:\n\nPb(NO\u2083)\u2082(aq) + 2 KI(aq) \u2192 PbI\u2082(s) + 2 KNO\u2083(aq)\n\nWhile lead nitrate, potassium iodide, and the potassium nitrate product are all soluble in cold water, the lead iodide product is not. The result is that the lead iodide comes out of solution as it's formed\u2014it precipitates.

Salts containing Group I ions (Li\u207a, Na\u207a, K\u207a, Cs\u207a, Rb\u207a) are soluble, with few exceptions. Salts containing the ammonium ion (NH\u2084\u207a) are also soluble.\n\n2. Salts containing nitrate ion (NO\u2083\u207b) are generally soluble.\n\n3. Salts containing Group 17 ions (Cl\u207b, Br\u207b, or I\u207b) are generally soluble. Important exceptions are halide salts of Ag\u207a, Pb\u00b2\u207a, and Hg\u2082\u00b2\u207a. Thus, AgCl, PbBr\u2082, and Hg\u2082Cl\u2082 are insoluble.\n\n4. Most silver salts are insoluble. AgNO\u2083 and Ag(C\u2082H\u2083O\u2082) are common soluble silver salts; virtually all others are insoluble.\n\n5. Most sulfate salts are soluble. Important exceptions include CaSO\u2084, BaSO\u2084, PbSO\u2084, Ag\u2082SO\u2084, and SrSO\u2084.\n\n6. Most hydroxide salts are only slightly soluble. Hydroxide salts of Group I ions are soluble. Hydroxide salts of Group II ions (Ca, Sr, and Ba) are slightly soluble. Hydroxide salts of transition metals and Al\u00b3\u207a are insoluble. Thus, Fe(OH)\u2083, Al(OH)\u2083, Co(OH)\u2082 are not soluble.\n\n7. Most sulfides of transition metals are highly insoluble, including CdS, FeS, ZnS, and Ag\u2082S. Arsenic, antimony, bismuth, and lead sulfides are also insoluble.\n\n8. Carbonates are frequently insoluble. Group II carbonates (CaCO\u2083, SrCO\u2083, and BaCO\u2083) are insoluble, as are FeCO\u2083 and PbCO\u2083.\n\n9. Chromates are frequently insoluble. Examples include PbCrO\u2084 and BaCrO\u2084.\n\n10. Phosphates such as Ca\u2083(PO\u2084)\u2082 and Ag\u2083PO\u2084 are frequently insoluble.\n\n11. Fluorides such as BaF\u2082, MgF\u2082, and PbF\u2082 are frequently insoluble.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's a lot of rules!

Like the periodic table, solubility rules can be easily looked up. Also like the periodic table, the more you work with the solubility rules, the more familiar they become. Working chemists know these rules not because they memorized them, but because they work with them regularly.\n\nConsider these two reactions we discussed:\n\nPb(NO\u2083)\u2082(aq) + 2 KI(aq) \u2192 PbI\u2082(s) + 2 KNO\u2083(aq)\n\nAgNO\u2083(aq) + NaCl(aq) \u2192 AgCl(s) + NaNO\u2083(aq)\n\nThese are known as double replacement reactions, which means the two reactants exchange atoms with each other.
