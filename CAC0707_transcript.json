What happens is that slaked lime, which is Ca(OH)₂, and aluminum sulfate, Al₂(SO₄)₃, react to form aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, and calcium sulfate, CaSO₄. Together, these form a gelatinous material. This process takes place in a large settling basin. Slow stirring causes this gelatinous material to clump together and settle to the bottom of the basin. As these clumps form and settle, they carry with them many of the dirt particles and bacteria.",

This further removes impurities.\n\nTo improve the odor and flavor of the water, many treatment facilities also aerate the water by cascading it through a column of air.

After aeration (which actually improves taste by dissolving air into the water—without dissolved air, water tastes flat), the water is treated with a disinfectant, usually chlorine gas, Cl₂, but sometimes ozone, O₃. Then it's stored in a holding tank that feeds into the city mains.

The water obtained from these deep wells, however, is highly contaminated with arsenic—a naturally occurring element in the Earth's crust.",

With the depletion of sources of natural fresh water in many regions, there has been growing interest in techniques for generating fresh water from the Earth's far larger reserves of seawater or from brackish (moderately salty) groundwater.

      "content": ": Correct! The two primary methods of removing salts from seawater or brackish water are distillation and reverse osmosis. These techniques are also highly effective in removing a host of other contaminants, such as pathogens, fertilizers, and pesticides. Distillation and reverse osmosis, therefore, are also used to purify naturally occurring fresh water. Many popular brands of bottled water, for example, contain fresh water that has been treated either by distillation or by reverse osmosis.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": You're right about distillation! It involves vaporizing water with heat and then condensing the vapors into purified liquid water. Earth's desalinized water is often produced using this technique. Because water has such a high heat of vaporization, however, this technique is energy intensive.\n\nThere are solar distillers that avoid burning fuels, but they require about 1 square meter of surface area to produce 4 liters of fresh water per day. For a single home or a small village, this surface-area requirement may be easily accommodated.\n\nNow, for reverse osmosis, we need to first understand osmosis. Osmosis involves a semipermeable membrane. A semipermeable membrane contains submicroscopic pores that allow the passage of water molecules but not of larger solute ions or solute molecules.",

      "content": ": I understand. Think of a semipermeable membrane like a very fine strainer or filter. Water molecules are tiny and can pass through the small holes in this filter, but larger molecules or ions (like salt) are too big and get blocked.\n\nWhen fresh water is separated from salt water by this semipermeable membrane, water molecules naturally move from the fresh water side to the salt water side. This happens because there are more water molecules along the fresh water face of the membrane than along the salt water face.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's a clever connection! Yes, that's related. When you consume salty foods, the higher concentration of salt in your digestive system draws water from your body tissues through osmosis, which can contribute to feeling dehydrated.\n\nTo continue with our discussion, the net movement of water from the fresh water side to the salt water side is called osmosis. The result is a buildup in volume of the salt water and a decrease in volume of the fresh water. These changes in volume, in turn, allow a buildup in pressure, called osmotic pressure.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's where reverse osmosis comes in! You're right that natural osmosis moves water from the fresh side to the salty side. In reverse osmosis, we apply external pressure to the salt water side. This pressure must be greater than the osmotic pressure.\n\nWhen we apply this pressure, we force water molecules to move in the opposite direction—from the salt water side to the fresh water side. The semipermeable membrane still blocks the salt ions, so what passes through is fresh water.",

      "content": ": You've identified a key challenge! The osmotic pressure for seawater is an astounding 24.8 atmospheres (365 pounds per square inch). Generating pressures greater than this has its share of technical difficulties and is an energy-intensive process.\n\nNonetheless, engineers have succeeded in building durable reverse osmosis units that can be networked together to generate fresh water from seawater at rates of millions of gallons per day. Reverse osmosis desalination facilities treating brackish water, which require much lower external pressures, are proportionately more economical.",
