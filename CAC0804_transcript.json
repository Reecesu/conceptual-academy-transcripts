Some of these molecules may reach the liquid's surface moving fast enough to overcome the hydrogen bonds and escape into the gaseous phase. This process of molecules converting from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase is called evaporation, or sometimes vaporization.\n\nThe opposite process is condensation—the changing of a gas to a liquid.

This has the effect of lowering the average kinetic energy of all the molecules remaining in the liquid, and the liquid is cooled.\n\nEvaporation also has a cooling effect on the surrounding air, because liquid molecules that escape into the gaseous phase are moving relatively slowly compared to other molecules in the air. This makes sense when you consider that these newly arrived molecules lost a fair amount of their kinetic energy in overcoming the hydrogen bonds of the liquid phase. Adding these slower molecules to the surrounding air effectively decreases the average kinetic energy of all the molecules making up the air, and the air is cooled.\n\nSo, no matter how you look at it, evaporation is a cooling process.",

As water cools, the rate of evaporation slows down, because fewer molecules have sufficient energy to escape the hydrogen bonds of the liquid phase. A higher rate of evaporation can be maintained if the water is in contact with a relatively warm surface, such as your skin. Body heat then flows from you into the water. In this way the water maintains a higher temperature, and evaporation continues at a relatively high rate.\n\nThis is why you feel cool as you dry off after getting wet—you are losing body heat to the energy-requiring process of evaporation.",

For example, dogs have no sweat glands (except between their toes). They cool themselves by panting. In this way, evaporation occurs in the mouth and the bronchial tract. Pigs also have no sweat glands and therefore cannot cool off by the evaporation of perspiration. Instead, they wallow in the mud to cool themselves.",

    {

      "content": ": That's an excellent conceptual question! If water were less \"sticky,\" you would be cooled more by its evaporation. Water molecules leave the liquid phase only when they have enough kinetic energy to overcome hydrogen bonding. It is hydrogen bonding that makes water sticky, so to say that water is less sticky is to say that hydrogen bonds are weaker than they actually are.\n\nThen at a given temperature, more molecules in the liquid phase would have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the weaker hydrogen bonds and escape into the gaseous phase, carrying heat away from the liquid. The cooling power of evaporating water would therefore be greater. This is why less \"sticky\" substances, such as rubbing alcohol, have a noticeably greater cooling effect as they evaporate.",

Warm water evaporates, but so does cool water. The only difference is that cool water evaporates at a slower rate.\n\nEven frozen water \"evaporates.\" This form of evaporation, in which molecules jump directly from the solid phase to the gaseous phase, is called sublimation. Because water molecules are so firmly held in the solid phase, frozen water does not release molecules into the gaseous phase as readily as liquid water does. Sublimation, however, does account for the loss of significant portions of snow and ice, especially on sunny, dry mountaintops. It's also why ice cubes left in the freezer for a long time tend to get smaller.",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes, that's right! The ice molecules can go directly from the solid phase to the gas phase without becoming liquid first. It's a slower process than melting and then evaporating, but it definitely happens.\n\nNow, let's talk about the opposite of evaporation - condensation. At the surface of any body of water, there is condensation as well as evaporation. Condensation occurs as slow-moving water vapor molecules collide with and stick to the surface of a body of liquid water. Fast-moving water vapor molecules tend to bounce off each other or off the liquid surface, losing little of their kinetic energy. Only the slowest gas molecules condense into the liquid phase.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes, you've identified the pattern! As condensation happens, energy is released as hydrogen bonds are formed. This energy is absorbed by the liquid and increases its temperature.\n\nCondensation involves the removal of slower-moving water vapor molecules from the gaseous phase. The average kinetic energy of the remaining water vapor molecules is therefore increased, which means that the water vapor is warmer. So, no matter how you look at it, condensation is a warming process.",

      "content": ": That's exactly right! A burn to your skin from 100°C water vapor is much more damaging than a burn from 100°C liquid water. Why? The water vapor gives up considerable energy when it condenses to a liquid and wets the skin.\n\nThis energy released by condensation is utilized in heating systems, such as household radiators. Heat is given up by water vapor when the vapor condenses inside the radiator.\n\nThe water vapor in our atmosphere also gives up energy as it condenses. This is the energy source for many weather systems, such as hurricanes, which derive much of their energy from the condensation of water vapor contained in humid tropical air. The formation of 1 inch of rain over an area of 1 square mile yields the energy equivalent of about 32,000 tons of exploded dynamite.",

After you take a shower, even a cold one, you are warmed by the heat energy released as the water vapor in the shower stall condenses. You quickly sense the difference if you step out of the stall. Away from the moisture, the rate of evaporation is much higher than the rate of condensation, and as a result, you feel chilly.\n\nWhen you remain in the shower stall, where the humidity is higher, the rate of condensation is increased, so you feel that much warmer. Now you know why you can dry yourself with a towel much more comfortably if you remain in the shower stall.",

In fact, there is much activity occurring at the molecular level. Both evaporation and condensation occur continuously and simultaneously.\n\nThe fact that the water level remains constant indicates equal rates of evaporation and condensation—the number of H₂O molecules leaving the liquid surface by evaporation is equal to the number entering the liquid by condensation.",

When liquid water is heated to a sufficiently high temperature, bubbles of water vapor form beneath the surface. These bubbles are buoyed to the surface, where they escape, and we say the liquid is boiling.\n\nBubbles can form only when the pressure of the vapor inside them is equal to or greater than the combined pressure exerted by the surrounding water and the atmosphere above. At the boiling point of the liquid, the pressure inside the bubbles equals or exceeds the combined pressure of the surrounding water and the atmosphere. At lower temperatures, the pressure inside the bubbles is not enough, and the surrounding pressure collapses any bubbles that form.",

This is why at what point boiling begins depends not only on temperature but also on pressure. This includes the pressure from the weight of the surrounding liquid as well as the pressure from the weight of the atmosphere at the surface.\n\nAs atmospheric pressure increases, the vapor molecules inside any bubbles that form must move faster in order to exert enough pressure from inside the bubble to counteract the additional atmospheric pressure.

In this way, the boiling temperature of the water is increased. Any food placed in this hotter water cooks more quickly than food placed in water boiling at 100°C.\n\nConversely, lower atmospheric pressure (as at high altitudes) decreases the boiling point of the liquid. In Denver, Colorado, the Mile-High City, for example, water boils at 95°C instead of the 100°C boiling temperature at sea level. If you try to cook food in boiling water that is cooler than 100°C, you must wait a longer time for proper cooking. A three-minute boiled egg in Denver is runny and undercooked.",

So boiling water remains at a constant temperature. If cooling did not take place, continued application of heat to a pot of boiling water would raise the temperature of the water. The reason the pressure cooker reaches higher temperatures is that boiling is forestalled by increased pressure, which in effect prevents cooling.",

It consists of a shallow dish of room-temperature water in a vacuum jar. When the pressure in the jar is slowly reduced by a vacuum pump, the water starts to boil. The boiling process takes heat away from the water, which consequently cools.\n\nAs the pressure is further reduced, more and more of the slower-moving liquid molecules boil away. Continued boiling results in a lowering of the temperature until the freezing point of approximately 0°C is reached. Continued cooling by boiling causes ice to form over the surface of the bubbling water. Boiling and freezing take place at the same time!

For example, if you spray some drops of coffee into a vacuum chamber, they, too, boil until they freeze. Even after they are frozen, the water molecules continue to evaporate into the vacuum until all that is left to be seen are little crystals of coffee solids. This is how freeze-dried coffee is made. The low temperature of this process tends to keep the chemical structure of the coffee solids from changing. When hot water is added, much of the original flavor of the coffee is retained.",

A motor pumps the coolant through the system as it undergoes the cyclic process of vaporization and condensation. The next time you're near a refrigerator, place your hand near the condensation coils in the back; you'll feel the heat that has been extracted from inside.\n\nAn air conditioner employs the same principle, pumping heat energy from inside a building to outside the building.
