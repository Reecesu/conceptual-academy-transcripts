      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Exactly! Those experiences relate directly to specific heat. Different substances have different capacities for storing energy. This happens because different materials absorb energy in different ways. When energy is added to a substance, it may increase the jiggling motion of molecules, which raises the temperature, or it may pull apart the attractions among molecules and therefore go into potential energy, which does not raise the temperature. Generally, there's a combination of both occurring.",

Specific heat is like a thermal version of inertia because it signifies the resistance of a substance to a change in temperature. With a higher specific heat, more energy is required to change the temperature. Each substance has its own characteristic specific heat, which can help in identifying it.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's part of it, but the complete answer once again involves hydrogen bonds. When heat is applied to water, much of that heat is consumed in breaking hydrogen bonds. These broken hydrogen bonds represent a form of potential energy - similar to when you pull two magnets apart. Much of the heat added to water is stored as this potential energy. Consequently, less heat is available to increase the kinetic energy of the water molecules.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Correct! Because temperature is a measure of kinetic energy, we find that as water is heated, its temperature rises slowly. By the same token, when water is cooled, its temperature drops slowly too. This happens because as the kinetic energy decreases, molecules slow down and more hydrogen bonds are able to re-form. This in turn releases heat that helps to maintain the temperature.",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes! As water cools down, it actually heats itself back up by the formation of hydrogen bonds. That's why it takes so long for water to cool down. You can think of water as a very effective \"heat sponge\" - it has a great capacity to hold onto heat, which is why specific heat is sometimes referred to as heat capacity.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Excellent reasoning! The specific heats of ice and water vapor are about half that of liquid water. Only liquid water has a remarkable specific heat. This is because the liquid phase is the only phase in which hydrogen bonds are continually breaking and re-forming.",

      "role": "assistant",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Actually, if you look at a map, you'd see Europe is at a high latitude similar to Canada. What happens is an ocean current carries warm water northeast from the Caribbean. The water holds much of its thermal energy long enough to reach the North Atlantic off the coast of Europe, where the water then cools. The energy released, 4.184 joules per degree Celsius for each gram of water that cools, is carried by the westerly winds (winds that blow west to east) over the European continent.",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's a wonderful way to think about it! This effect impacts coastal areas worldwide. The winds in the latitudes of North America are westerly. On the western coast of the continent, air moves from the Pacific Ocean to the land. Because of water's high specific heat, ocean temperatures don't vary much from summer to winter. In winter, the water warms the air, which is then blown eastward over the coastal regions. In summer, the water cools the air and the coastal regions are cooled.",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Absolutely! On the eastern coast of the continent, the temperature moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean are significant, but because the winds blow from the west—over land—temperature ranges in the east are much greater than in the west. San Francisco, for example, is warmer in winter and cooler in summer than Washington, D.C., which is at about the same latitude.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Correct! The temperature of water increases less compared to the temperature of sand in the same sunlight. Water therefore has the higher specific heat. Those who visit the beach frequently know that beach sand quickly turns hot on a sunny day, while the water remains relatively cool. At night, however, the sand feels quite cool, while the water's temperature feels about the same as it did during the day.",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Absolutely. Public discussions of global climate change tend to focus on the average temperature of the atmosphere, which is increasing in concert with increasing levels of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas. An average rise of 3°C is understood to be undesirable. But what of the oceans, which are not only much more massive, but also have a significantly higher specific heat? The amount of energy required to raise the temperature of the oceans by 3°C is many orders of magnitude greater than that required to raise the temperature of the atmosphere.",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes. Knowing about water's high specific heat, you'll understand that the bulk of solar radiation trapped by the atmosphere simply makes its way to the oceans. So, all of us, not just islanders, benefit from water's ability to absorb energy and thus moderate the climate. That's the good news.\n\nThe bad news is that direct measurements show the average surface ocean temperature has increased by about 0.7°C over the past century. This represents a colossal amount of energy. Because water expands upon warming, this has contributed to a rise in sea level.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's a good question. Given water's high specific heat, even this seemingly small temperature increase represents an enormous amount of energy absorbed by the oceans. Significantly, the northern polar ice cap is gradually disappearing and the warmer oceans are breeding grounds for more violent weather systems. Furthermore, warmer oceans are able to hold less carbon dioxide, which accelerates the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.\n\nClearly, public discussions should also focus on the changing state of our oceans. In summary, the oceans moderate our climate in great part because of water's high specific heat. Any temperature changes to the oceans will necessarily be slow so as not to be noticed over a single decade. But the changes that occur will also necessarily be enduring.",
