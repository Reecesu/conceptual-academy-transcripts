    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's a common point of confusion. The heat energy being added isn't raising the temperature because it's being used to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules in the ice. This process of melting 1 gram of ice requires 335 joules of energy.",

Now all the added heat is going into evaporating the liquid water to water vapor. The water must absorb 2259 joules of heat to evaporate all the liquid water. That's a stunning amount of energy!",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's a thoughtful observation. It takes more energy because in the liquid state, water molecules are still connected by many hydrogen bonds, though they can move past each other. To become a gas, these molecules need to break free from almost all molecular attractions, which requires significantly more energy than just loosening the rigid structure of ice.",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": When the phase changes are in the opposite direction, the amounts of heat energy are released rather than absorbed. So that's 2259 joules per gram released when water vapor condenses to liquid water and 335 joules per gram released when liquid water turns to ice. The processes are completely reversible.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": For that process, the water would release 418 joules of energy. This isn't a phase change - it's just cooling the liquid - but we can calculate it because water's specific heat tells us it releases 4.184 joules per gram for each degree Celsius it cools.",

      "role": "assistant",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": You're making an excellent observation! These values are indeed high relative to most other substances. This is due to the large amount of energy required to break the hydrogen bonds in liquid water to form water vapor.

In fact, ice can have any temperature below 0°C, down to absolute zero, –273°C. Adding heat to ice below 0°C raises its temperature, say, from –200°C to –100°C. As long as its temperature stays below 0°C, the ice does not melt.",

Another interesting point is that although water vapor at 100°C and liquid water at 100°C have the same temperature, each gram of the vapor contains an additional 2259 joules of potential energy. As the molecules bind together to form the liquid phase, this energy is released to the surroundings as heat.",

      "role": "assistant",

      "content": ": Absolutely! Water's high heat of vaporization allows you to briefly touch your wetted finger to a hot skillet or hot stove without harm.

When your feet are wet, either because they are perspiring or because you're stepping off wet grass, much of the heat from the coals is absorbed by the water and not by your skin. Firewalking also relies on the fact that wood is a poor conductor of heat, even when it's in the form of red-hot coals.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Great question! Many of water's properties are interconnected. Ice floats because hydrogen bonds hold together the H2O molecules in ice in an open crystalline structure that makes the ice less dense than liquid water.
