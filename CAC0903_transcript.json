This gives the relative ratio of atoms:\n\nFor carbon: 40.123% ÷ 12.011 amu = 3.341\nFor hydrogen: 6.670% ÷ 1.008 amu = 6.617\nFor oxygen: 53.332% ÷ 15.999 amu = 3.333\n\nNext, they would divide each value by the smallest number and round to the nearest whole number:\n\nFor carbon: 3.341 ÷ 3.333 = 1\nFor hydrogen: 6.617 ÷ 3.333 = 2\nFor oxygen: 3.333 ÷ 3.333 = 1\n\nSo the empirical formula is C₁H₂O₁, usually written as CH₂O.\n\nThis rounding accounts for experimental errors from the combustion analysis. The empirical formula was a chemist's first step in discovering a compound's molecular formula, which would be some multiple of the empirical formula.",

Historically, chemists used methods like measuring the compound's molecular weight through various experimental techniques like crystallography. By comparing the molecular weight to the weight of the empirical formula unit, they could determine the multiplier.\n\nFor example, if they found that glucose's molecular weight was about 180 g/mol, and the empirical formula CH₂O has a weight of about 30 g/mol, they would know the molecular formula is (CH₂O)₆ or C₆H₁₂O₆.",

In theory, chemical reactions should give you exactly the amount of product predicted by stoichiometry, but in practice, you often get less.\n\nFor example, let's consider the synthesis of methyl salicylate (the compound responsible for the smell and taste of wintergreen) from salicylic acid and methanol:\n\nC₇H₆O₃ + CH₃OH → C₈H₈O₃ + H₂O\n\nAccording to this equation, methyl salicylate forms from salicylic acid in a 1:1 mole ratio. If you start with 138 grams of salicylic acid (1 mole), then ideally, you should obtain 152 grams of methyl salicylate (1 mole).",
