      "content": ": Of course! It's standard practice to assign a plus sign to energy absorbed and a minus sign to energy released. For instance, when dealing with a reaction in which 1 mole of H–H bonds are broken, you write +436 kilojoules to indicate energy absorbed. The positive sign indicates that the molecules gained energy, which was used to break the bonds. When dealing with the formation of 1 mole of H–H bonds, you write –436 kilojoules to indicate energy released.

The net energy of the reaction is found by adding the two quantities:\n+1370 kilojoules + (–1856 kilojoules) = –486 kilojoules\n\nThe negative sign on the net energy indicates that there is a net release of energy, so the reaction is exothermic.",

For any exothermic reaction, energy can be considered a product and is thus sometimes included after the arrow of the chemical equation:\nH₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O + energy\n\nIn an exothermic reaction, the potential energy of atoms in the product molecules is lower than their potential energy in the reactant molecules. The lowered potential energy of the atoms in the product molecules is due to their being more tightly held together.",

The loss of potential energy is balanced by a gain in kinetic energy. Like two free-floating magnets coming together and accelerating to higher speeds, the potential energy of the reactants is converted to faster-moving atoms and molecules, electromagnetic radiation, or both.",

The reaction of large amounts of hydrogen and oxygen, for example, provided the energy to lift the Space Shuttle into orbit. There were two compartments in the large central tank, to which the orbiter was attached—one filled with liquid hydrogen and the other with liquid oxygen.

Additional thrust for the Space Shuttle was obtained from a pair of solid-fuel rocket boosters containing a mixture of ammonium perchlorate, NH₄ClO₄, and powdered aluminum, Al.

The energy that an exothermic reaction releases always goes somewhere into the environment, often in the form of thermal energy (heat), but other forms, such as light energy or electric energy, are also possible.
