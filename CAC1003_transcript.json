    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's a common misconception. While water is indeed neutral overall, it's also amphoteric, meaning it has the ability to react with itself. In behaving as an acid, a water molecule donates a hydrogen ion to a neighboring water molecule, which, in accepting the hydrogen ion, is behaving as a base. This reaction produces a hydroxide ion and a hydronium ion, which can react together to reform the water molecule.",

In pure water, therefore, the total number of hydronium ions must be the same as the total number of hydroxide ions. Experiments reveal that the concentration of hydronium and hydroxide ions in pure water is extremely low—about 0.00000010 M for each, where M stands for molarity, or moles per liter. Water by itself, therefore, is a very weak acid as well as a very weak base.",

      "content": ": Exactly! Now, let me tell you about something interesting regarding the concentrations of these ions. Further experiments reveal an interesting rule pertaining to the concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions in any solution that contains water. The concentration of hydronium ions in any aqueous solution multiplied by the concentration of the hydroxide ions in the solution always equals the constant Kw, which is a very, very small number:\n\nconcentration H₃O⁺ × concentration OH⁻ = Kw = 0.000000000000010\n\nWe can write this using scientific notation and brackets to indicate molarity:\n\n[H₃O⁺][OH⁻] = Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Don't worry about all those zeros. Here's why this matters: For pure water, the value of Kw is the concentration of hydronium ions, 0.00000010 M, multiplied by the concentration of hydroxide ions, 0.00000010 M, which can be written in scientific notation as:\n\n[1.0 × 10⁻⁷][1.0 × 10⁻⁷] = Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴\n\nThe constant value of Kw is quite significant because it means that no matter what is dissolved in the water, the product of the hydronium-ion and hydroxide-ion concentrations always equals 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴. So, if the concentration of H₃O⁺ goes up, the concentration of OH⁻ must go down, and the product of the two remains 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴.",

    {

      "content": ": That's an excellent analogy! Yes, they behave exactly like a seesaw. Let me test your understanding with a couple of questions. In pure water, the hydroxide-ion concentration is 1.0 × 10⁻⁷ M. What would the hydronium-ion concentration be?",

    },
    {

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's okay. Let's work through it. We know that [H₃O⁺][OH⁻] must equal 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴. If [OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻³ M, then:\n\n[H₃O⁺] × 1.0 × 10⁻³ = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴\n\nTo solve for [H₃O⁺], we divide both sides by 1.0 × 10⁻³:\n\n[H₃O⁺] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ ÷ 1.0 × 10⁻³ = 1.0 × 10⁻¹¹ M",

    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": ": Oh, I see. So when the hydroxide concentration goes up (to 10⁻³), the hydronium concentration has to go down (to 10⁻¹¹) to keep their product constant at 10⁻¹⁴.",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Exactly! I should also mention that Kw is an equilibrium constant. As described in previous chemistry topics, an equilibrium constant equals the concentrations of the products over reactants. You'll notice that for this reaction the reactant is water. The concentration of water in water is about 55.5 M, which is huge compared to the super tiny concentrations of the hydronium and hydroxide ion products. Because water's concentration is so huge, any changes to it are insignificant, which is why, for Kw, it can be ignored.\n\nAlso, chemical equilibrium can be temperature dependent, as is the case for water reacting with water. Strictly speaking, Kw = 1 × 10⁻¹⁴ only at room temperature, 25°C. At higher temperatures, Kw gets larger. For example, at 40°C Kw = 2.9 × 10⁻¹⁴, which means the pH of neutral water is 6.7.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes, temperature has a significant effect on many chemical equilibria. Now, let's discuss what makes a solution neutral, acidic, or basic. Any solution containing an equal number of hydronium and hydroxide ions is said to be neutral. Pure water is an example of a neutral solution—not because it contains so few hydronium or hydroxide ions, but because it contains equal numbers of these ions.",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Great question! The balance of hydronium and hydroxide ions in a neutral solution is upset by adding either an acid or a base. Add an acid and the water will react with that acid to produce more hydronium ions. Many of these additional hydronium ions neutralize hydroxide ions, which then become fewer. The final result is that the hydronium-ion concentration is greater than the hydroxide-ion concentration. Such a solution is said to be acidic.\n\nAdd a base to water and the reverse happens. The water will react with that base to produce more hydroxide ions. Many of these additional hydroxide ions will neutralize hydronium ions, which then become fewer. The final result is that the hydronium-ion concentration is less than the hydroxide-ion concentration. Such a solution is said to be basic, or sometimes alkaline.",

      "content": ": That's an excellent question! Ammonia indirectly increases the hydroxide-ion concentration by reacting with water:\n\nNH₃ + H₂O ⇌ NH₄⁺ + OH⁻\n\nThis reaction raises the hydroxide-ion concentration, which has the effect of lowering the hydronium-ion concentration. With the hydroxide-ion concentration now higher than the hydronium-ion concentration, the solution is basic.",

Here's another interesting fact: Above temperatures of 374°C and pressures of 218 atmospheres, water transforms into a state of matter known as a supercritical fluid, which resembles both a liquid and a gas. For a neutral solution of supercritical water, the pH equals about 2, which means that it has high concentrations of both hydronium and hydroxide ions and is highly corrosive.
