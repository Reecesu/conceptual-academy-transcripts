In any battery, the anode is always negative (–), which indicates that electrons are streaming away from this location.

The reduction of ammonium ions in a dry-cell battery produces two gases - ammonia (NH₃) and hydrogen (H₂) - that need to be removed to avoid a pressure buildup and a potential explosion.\n\nThis removal is accomplished by having the ammonia and hydrogen react with the zinc chloride and manganese dioxide:\n\nZnCl₂(aq) + 2 NH₃(g) → Zn(NH₃)₂Cl₂(s)\n\n2 MnO₂(s) + H₂(g) → Mn₂O₃(s) + H₂O(l)",

Even while the battery is not operating, the zinc corrodes as it reacts with ammonium ions.\n\nInterestingly, this zinc corrosion can be inhibited by storing the battery in a refrigerator. As you might have learned, chemical reactions slow down with decreasing temperature. Chilling a battery, therefore, slows down the rate at which the zinc corrodes, which increases the life of the battery.",

As the battery provides electricity, the hydride ion releases electrons, which allows it to join with the hydroxide ion to re-form water:\n\nH:Ni + HO⁻ → H₂O + Ni + e⁻\nNickel hydride + hydroxide ion → water + nickel metal + electron",

For the NiMH battery, this chemical is nickel hydride (H:Ni).\n\nFor a traditional car battery, the electron-producing chemical is lead (Pb), which transforms into lead sulfate (PbSO₄) as it releases electrons. As the car battery is recharged, the PbSO₄ is transformed back into lead (Pb). This is an endothermic reaction, which requires the input of energy that comes from an on-board generator, also known as the alternator. The alternator, in turn, gets its energy from the car's internal-combustion engine, which is driven by the energy of the fuel in the gas tank.",

A safer variant called lithium phosphate ion batteries are used for today's hybrid and fully electric cars, which have grown in popularity.\n\nHybrids have improved gas mileage because as the car slows down, its kinetic energy is transformed into the electric potential energy of the battery rather than being wasted as heat from the car's brake pads. The captured electrical energy of the battery is subsequently used to assist the gas-powered engine to get the car moving.\n\nAlso, the hybrid's battery system allows the engine to shut off when the car is merely idling or moving slowly, as occurs in heavy traffic. The fully electric cars are recognized for being environmentally friendly, though they still rely on fossil fuels due to the manufacture of the car itself, and potentially when the electricity powering the car comes from a fossil fuel dependent source.",

When a rechargeable battery is being recharged, however, what was once the negative anode now becomes a negative cathode, which is where electrons are needed for reduction. Because electrons won't travel to a negative cathode on their own, they must be forced to do so. Hence, recharging is an energy-consuming process.",
