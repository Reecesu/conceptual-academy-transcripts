Additionally, carbon atoms can bond with atoms of other elements, which creates the possibility for an endless number of different carbon-based molecules.\n\nEach of these molecules has its own unique set of physical, chemical, and biological properties. For instance, the flavor of vanilla comes from a compound called vanillin. When vanillin is absorbed by the sensory organs in your nose, you perceive the vanilla flavor. Without vanillin, there is no vanilla flavor.",

There are three hydrocarbons called pentane, isopentane, and neopentane. All three have the exact same molecular formula, C₅H₁₂, but they are structurally different from one another.\n\nIn pentane, the carbon framework is a straight chain of five carbon atoms. In isopentane, the carbon chain branches, so that the framework is a four-carbon chain branched at the second carbon. In neopentane, a central carbon atom is bonded to four surrounding carbon atoms.",

However, the way these atoms are put together—their configuration—is different.\n\nThis creates different chemical structures. Molecules with the same chemical formula but different configurations are known as structural isomers. These structural isomers are truly different from each other, having different physical and chemical properties.\n\nFor example, pentane has a boiling point of 36°C, isopentane's boiling point is 30°C, and neopentane's is 10°C. So even though they have the same atoms, their different structures give them different properties.",

And yes, carbon-based molecules can have different spatial orientations, which we call conformations.\n\nThink about how you can flex your wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints to move your arm through a range of positions. Similarly, organic molecules can twist and turn about their carbon–carbon single bonds and thus have a range of conformations.\n\nFor pentane, there are different conformations the molecule can take while still maintaining its pentane configuration. However, if you change the configuration of pentane, you no longer have pentane. Instead, you have a different structural isomer, such as isopentane, which has its own range of possible conformations.",

The \"di\" prefix indicates that there are two methyl groups.\n\nWhen naming these compounds, we always use the lowest possible numbers. For example, if you numbered the hexane chain from the opposite end, you'd get 4,5-dimethylhexane, which is the identical structure. But by convention, we use 2,3-dimethylhexane since those numbers are lower.",

Here's why:\n\nWe identify the longest carbon chain first, which in this case is a three-carbon chain (propane). Then we note that there are two methyl groups (thus \"dimethyl\") and both are attached to the second carbon of the propane chain (thus \"2,2\"). The \"2\" is used twice because each methyl group needs its own number, and they happen to be on the same carbon.",

Most of the coal and petroleum that exist today were formed between 290 million and 354 million years ago, when plant and animal matter decayed in the absence of oxygen.\n\nDuring that time, Earth was covered with extensive swamps that periodically became submerged because they were close to sea level. The organic matter of these swamps was buried beneath layers of marine sediments and eventually transformed into either coal or petroleum.\n\nCoal is a solid material containing many large, complex hydrocarbon molecules. Most coal mined today is used for steel production and for generating electricity at coal-burning power plants.\n\nPetroleum, also called crude oil, is a liquid that can be separated into its hydrocarbon components through a process known as fractional distillation.",

      "content": ": It does sound fancy, but it's actually a fairly straightforward process! In fractional distillation, crude oil is heated to a temperature high enough to vaporize most of its components. The hot vapor flows into the bottom of a fractionating tower, which is warmer at the bottom than at the top.\n\nAs the vapor rises in the tower and cools, the various components begin to condense. Hydrocarbons that have high boiling points, such as tar, condense first at warmer temperatures. Hydrocarbons that have low boiling points, such as gasoline, travel to the cooler regions at the top of the tower before condensing.\n\nPipes drain the various liquid hydrocarbon fractions from the tower. Natural gas, which is primarily methane, does not condense. It remains a gas and is collected at the top of the tower.",

These are the molecules that have lower boiling points. So the lower the boiling point, the higher the molecules rise.\n\nThis behavior is explained by differences in the strength of molecular attractions. Larger hydrocarbons experience many more induced dipole-induced dipole attractions than smaller hydrocarbons do. These stronger attractions make larger hydrocarbons condense readily at high temperatures, so they're found at the bottom of the tower. Smaller molecules, with fewer attractions to neighbors, condense only at the cooler temperatures found at the top of the tower.",

Some of these components burn more efficiently than others in a car engine.\n\nThe straight-chain hydrocarbons, such as heptane, burn too quickly, causing what's called engine knock. This happens when the fuel ignites from compression alone before the spark plug fires, disrupting the engine cycle.\n\nGasoline hydrocarbons that have more branching, such as isooctane, burn more slowly and result in the engine running more smoothly.\n\nHeptane and isooctane are used as standards in assigning octane ratings to gasoline. An octane number of 100 is arbitrarily assigned to isooctane, and heptane is assigned an octane number of 0. The anti-knock performance of a particular gasoline is compared with those of various mixtures of isooctane and heptane, and an octane number is assigned.",

For such cars, higher-octane gasoline may actually provide poorer performance at a greater cost. You should check your car's manual to see what octane rating the manufacturer recommends.\n\nGoing back to our earlier discussion of structural isomers like pentane, isopentane, and neopentane - which one do you think would have the highest octane rating?",
