The hydroxyl group consists of an oxygen bonded to a hydrogen. Because of the polarity of the oxygen-hydrogen bond, low-formula-mass alcohols are often soluble in water, which is itself very polar.</p></div>

Methanol, also called wood alcohol because it can be obtained from wood, should NEVER be ingested. In the body, methanol is metabolized to formaldehyde, H₂CO, and formic acid, HCO₂H. Formaldehyde is harmful to the eyes, can lead to blindness, and was once used to preserve dead biological specimens. Formic acid, the active ingredient in an ant bite, can lower the pH of the blood to dangerous levels. Ingesting only about 15 milliliters (about 3 tablespoons) of methanol may lead to blindness, and about 30 milliliters can cause death.</p></div>

While ethanol is less toxic than methanol, it's worth noting that the body metabolizes ethanol into acetaldehyde, CH₃COH. Acetaldehyde won't cause blindness, but it does lead to some painful side effects, which people who drink too much experience as part of their hangover.</p></div>

This is why most wines have an alcohol content of about 12 percent—they are produced solely by fermentation. To attain the higher ethanol concentrations found in such "hard" alcoholic beverages as gin and vodka, the fermented liquid must be distilled.</p><br><p>In the United States, the ethanol content of distilled alcoholic beverages is measured as proof, which is twice the percentage of ethanol. An 86-proof whiskey, for example, is 43 percent ethanol by volume. The term proof evolved from a crude method once employed to test alcohol content. Gunpowder was wetted with a beverage of suspect alcohol content. If the beverage was primarily water, the powder would not ignite. If the beverage contained a significant amount of ethanol, the powder would burn, thus providing "proof" of the beverage's worth.</p></div>

Although 2-propanol has a relatively high boiling point, it evaporates readily, leading to a pronounced cooling effect when it is applied to skin—an effect once used to reduce fevers. However, isopropyl alcohol is very toxic if ingested. In place of isopropyl alcohol, washcloths wetted with cold water are also quite effective in reducing fever, and they are far safer. You are probably most familiar with the use of isopropyl alcohol as a topical disinfectant.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-30"><p>That's an excellent question that shows you're making connections! The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) in sodium hydroxide is indeed basic. However, in a phenol, the hydroxyl group behaves differently because it's attached to a benzene ring.</p><br><p>The reason for this acidity is related to how well the molecule can accommodate a negative charge. How readily an acid donates a hydrogen ion is a function of how well the acid is able to accommodate the resulting negative charge it gains after donating the hydrogen ion. After a phenol donates the hydrogen ion, it becomes a negatively charged phenoxide ion. The negative charge of the phenoxide ion, however, is not restricted to the oxygen atom.</p><br><p>Recall that the electrons of the benzene ring are able to migrate around the ring. In a similar manner, the electrons responsible for the negative charge of the phenoxide ion are also able to migrate around the ring. Just as it is easy for several people to hold a hot potato by quickly passing it around, it is easy for the phenoxide ion to hold the negative charge because the charge gets passed around. Because the negative charge of the ion is so nicely accommodated, the phenolic group is more acidic than it would be otherwise.</p></div>

If the alcohol were to donate the hydroxyl hydrogen, the result would be a negative charge on the oxygen. Without an adjacent benzene ring, this negative charge has nowhere to go. As a result, an alcohol behaves only as a very weak acid, much like water.</p></div>

In 1867, Joseph Lister discovered the antiseptic value of phenol, which, when applied to surgical instruments and incisions, greatly increased surgery survival rates. Phenol was the first purposefully used antibacterial solution, or antiseptic.</p><br><p>However, phenol damages healthy tissue, so a number of milder phenols have since been introduced. The phenol 4-hexylresorcinol, for example, is commonly used in throat lozenges and mouthwashes. This compound has even greater antiseptic properties than phenol, yet it does not damage tissue. Listerine® brand mouthwash (named after Joseph Lister) contains the antiseptic phenols thymol and methyl salicylate.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-40"><p>That's a thoughtful question! Ethers are not very soluble in water because, without the hydroxyl group, they are unable to form strong hydrogen bonds with water. Furthermore, without the polar hydroxyl group, the molecular attractions among ether molecules are relatively weak. As a result, little energy is required to separate ether molecules from one another. This is why low-formula-mass ethers have relatively low boiling points and evaporate so readily.</p></div>

The anesthetic properties of this compound were discovered in the early 1800s, and its use revolutionized the practice of surgery.</p><br><p>Because of its high volatility at room temperature, inhaled diethyl ether rapidly enters the bloodstream. Because this ether has low solubility in water and high volatility, it quickly leaves the bloodstream once introduced. Because of these physical properties, a surgical patient can be brought into and out of general anesthesia (a state of unconsciousness) simply by regulating the gases breathed. Modern-day gaseous anesthetics have fewer side effects than diethyl ether, but they operate on the same principle.</p></div>

Alcohols can be classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary based on where the hydroxyl group is attached.</p><br><p>3.

So let's start with methanol - is that something people drink?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a critical question that highlights an important safety concern. Methanol, also called wood alcohol because it can be obtained from wood, should NEVER be ingested. In the body, methanol is metabolized to formaldehyde, H\u2082CO, and formic acid, HCO\u2082H. Formaldehyde is harmful to the eyes, can lead to blindness, and was once used to preserve dead biological specimens. Formic acid, the active ingredient in an ant bite, can lower the pH of the blood to dangerous levels. Ingesting only about 15 milliliters (about 3 tablespoons) of methanol may lead to blindness, and about 30 milliliters can cause death.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wow, that's scary!

So what is methanol used for if it's not for drinking?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Billions of pounds of methanol are produced annually in the United States.

In addition, methanol is used as a solvent, an octane booster, and an anti-icing agent in gasoline.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": And ethanol is the one in alcoholic drinks, right? That seems safer.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, ethanol, C\u2082H\u2085OH, is indeed the \"alcohol\" in alcoholic beverages, and it's one of the oldest chemicals manufactured by humans. While ethanol is less toxic than methanol, it's worth noting that the body metabolizes ethanol into acetaldehyde, CH\u2083COH. Acetaldehyde won't cause blindness, but it does lead to some painful side effects, which people who drink too much experience as part of their hangover.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That explains hangovers! So how do they make ethanol for drinks?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Ethanol is prepared by feeding the sugars of various plants to certain yeasts, which produce ethanol through a biological process known as fermentation. Ethanol is also widely used as an industrial solvent. For many years, ethanol intended for industrial use was made by fermentation, but today industrial-grade ethanol is more cheaply manufactured from petroleum by-products such as ethene.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I've heard that different alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol. How does that work?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": The liquid produced by fermentation has an ethanol concentration no greater than about 12 percent, because at this concentration, the yeast cells begin to die. This is why most wines have an alcohol content of about 12 percent\u2014they are produced solely by fermentation. To attain the higher ethanol concentrations found in such \"hard\" alcoholic beverages as gin and vodka, the fermented liquid must be distilled.\n\nIn the United States, the ethanol content of distilled alcoholic beverages is measured as proof, which is twice the percentage of ethanol. An 86-proof whiskey, for example, is 43 percent ethanol by volume. The term proof evolved from a crude method once employed to test alcohol content. Gunpowder was wetted with a beverage of suspect alcohol content. If the beverage was primarily water, the powder would not ignite. If the beverage contained a significant amount of ethanol, the powder would burn, thus providing \"proof\" of the beverage's worth.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's a cool story about the proof test! Are there any other common alcohols I might know about?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, a third well-known alcohol is isopropyl alcohol, also called 2-propanol.

However, isopropyl alcohol is very toxic if ingested. In place of isopropyl alcohol, washcloths wetted with cold water are also quite effective in reducing fever, and they are far safer. You are probably most familiar with the use of isopropyl alcohol as a topical disinfectant.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Oh yeah, I've definitely used that to clean cuts and scrapes. So alcohols can be classified in different ways, right?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's right! Alcohols can be classified as being primary, secondary, or tertiary. In a primary alcohol, the hydroxyl group is attached to the terminal carbon of a carbon chain. An example is ethanol. In a secondary alcohol, the hydroxyl group is attached to a central carbon, as seen with 2-propanol. For a tertiary alcohol, the hydroxyl group is attached to a carbon that is bonded to three other carbon atoms, as occurs in 2-methyl-2-propanol.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I'm trying to visualize 2-methyl-2-propanol.

In 2-methyl-2-propanol, we have a central carbon that has the hydroxyl (-OH) group attached to it. This central carbon also has three other carbon atoms attached to it. One of these carbons is from the methyl group (-CH\u2083) that gives the molecule part of its name. The other two carbons are part of the propanol backbone. So the central carbon has four attachments: one OH group and three carbon atoms.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That makes more sense, thanks. So we've talked about alcohols. What are phenols?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Phenols contain a phenolic group, which consists of a hydroxyl group bonded to a benzene ring. Because of the presence of the benzene ring, the hydrogen of the hydroxyl group is readily lost in an acid-base reaction, which makes the phenolic group mildly acidic.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wait, I thought -OH groups were basic? Like in sodium hydroxide (NaOH)? Why would phenols be acidic?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's an excellent question that shows you're making connections! The hydroxide ion (OH\u207b) in sodium hydroxide is indeed basic. However, in a phenol, the hydroxyl group behaves differently because it's attached to a benzene ring.\n\nThe reason for this acidity is related to how well the molecule can accommodate a negative charge. How readily an acid donates a hydrogen ion is a function of how well the acid is able to accommodate the resulting negative charge it gains after donating the hydrogen ion. After a phenol donates the hydrogen ion, it becomes a negatively charged phenoxide ion. The negative charge of the phenoxide ion, however, is not restricted to the oxygen atom.\n\nRecall that the electrons of the benzene ring are able to migrate around the ring. In a similar manner, the electrons responsible for the negative charge of the phenoxide ion are also able to migrate around the ring. Just as it is easy for several people to hold a hot potato by quickly passing it around, it is easy for the phenoxide ion to hold the negative charge because the charge gets passed around. Because the negative charge of the ion is so nicely accommodated, the phenolic group is more acidic than it would be otherwise.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That makes sense - the benzene ring helps stabilize the negative charge by spreading it out. So if phenols are mildly acidic, are regular alcohols acidic too?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Great question! Alcohols are less acidic than phenols. An alcohol does not contain a benzene ring adjacent to the hydroxyl group. If the alcohol were to donate the hydroxyl hydrogen, the result would be a negative charge on the oxygen. Without an adjacent benzene ring, this negative charge has nowhere to go. As a result, an alcohol behaves only as a very weak acid, much like water.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Are phenols common compounds? What are they used for?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, phenols are quite common. The simplest phenol is actually called phenol. In 1867, Joseph Lister discovered the antiseptic value of phenol, which, when applied to surgical instruments and incisions, greatly increased surgery survival rates. Phenol was the first purposefully used antibacterial solution, or antiseptic.\n\nHowever, phenol damages healthy tissue, so a number of milder phenols have since been introduced. The phenol 4-hexylresorcinol, for example, is commonly used in throat lozenges and mouthwashes. This compound has even greater antiseptic properties than phenol, yet it does not damage tissue. Listerine\u00ae brand mouthwash (named after Joseph Lister) contains the antiseptic phenols thymol and methyl salicylate.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Oh, I never knew that's where Listerine got its name! So we've covered alcohols and phenols. What about ethers? I've heard of ether being used in old-time surgery.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Ethers are organic compounds structurally related to alcohols. The oxygen atom in an ether group, however, is bonded not to a carbon and a hydrogen, but rather to two carbons.\n\nFor example, ethanol and dimethyl ether have the same chemical formula, C\u2082H\u2086O, but their physical properties are vastly different. Whereas ethanol is a liquid at room temperature (boiling point 78\u00b0C) and mixes quite well with water, dimethyl ether is a gas at room temperature (boiling point \u201325\u00b0C) and is much less soluble in water.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So the same atoms can be arranged differently and give completely different properties? That's actually pretty cool.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Exactly! That's one of the fascinating aspects of chemistry. The oxygen in an alcohol, such as ethanol, is bonded to one carbon atom and one hydrogen atom. The oxygen in an ether, such as dimethyl ether, is bonded to two carbon atoms. Because of this difference, alcohols and ethers of similar molecular mass have vastly different physical properties.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Why aren't ethers soluble in water if they have oxygen in them? I thought oxygen made things more water-soluble.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a thoughtful question! Ethers are not very soluble in water because, without the hydroxyl group, they are unable to form strong hydrogen bonds with water. Furthermore, without the polar hydroxyl group, the molecular attractions among ether molecules are relatively weak. As a result, little energy is required to separate ether molecules from one another. This is why low-formula-mass ethers have relatively low boiling points and evaporate so readily.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I think I remember hearing about ether being used as an anesthetic in old movies. Is that true?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, you're absolutely right! Diethyl ether was one of the first general anesthetics. The anesthetic properties of this compound were discovered in the early 1800s, and its use revolutionized the practice of surgery.\n\nBecause of its high volatility at room temperature, inhaled diethyl ether rapidly enters the bloodstream. Because this ether has low solubility in water and high volatility, it quickly leaves the bloodstream once introduced. Because of these physical properties, a surgical patient can be brought into and out of general anesthesia (a state of unconsciousness) simply by regulating the gases breathed. Modern-day gaseous anesthetics have fewer side effects than diethyl ether, but they operate on the same principle.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That makes a lot of sense - the properties of the molecule make it perfect for that use.

Alcohols can be classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary based on where the hydroxyl group is attached.\n\n3.
