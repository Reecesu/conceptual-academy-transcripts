An 86-proof whiskey, for example, is 43 percent ethanol by volume. The term proof evolved from a crude method once employed to test alcohol content. Gunpowder was wetted with a beverage of suspect alcohol content. If the beverage was primarily water, the powder would not ignite.

      "content": ": That's an excellent question that shows you're making connections! The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) in sodium hydroxide is indeed basic. However, in a phenol, the hydroxyl group behaves differently because it's attached to a benzene ring.\n\nThe reason for this acidity is related to how well the molecule can accommodate a negative charge. How readily an acid donates a hydrogen ion is a function of how well the acid is able to accommodate the resulting negative charge it gains after donating the hydrogen ion. After a phenol donates the hydrogen ion, it becomes a negatively charged phenoxide ion. The negative charge of the phenoxide ion, however, is not restricted to the oxygen atom.\n\nRecall that the electrons of the benzene ring are able to migrate around the ring. In a similar manner, the electrons responsible for the negative charge of the phenoxide ion are also able to migrate around the ring. Just as it is easy for several people to hold a hot potato by quickly passing it around, it is easy for the phenoxide ion to hold the negative charge because the charge gets passed around. Because the negative charge of the ion is so nicely accommodated, the phenolic group is more acidic than it would be otherwise.",

As a result, an alcohol behaves only as a very weak acid, much like water.",

Phenol was the first purposefully used antibacterial solution, or antiseptic.\n\nHowever, phenol damages healthy tissue, so a number of milder phenols have since been introduced. The phenol 4-hexylresorcinol, for example, is commonly used in throat lozenges and mouthwashes. This compound has even greater antiseptic properties than phenol, yet it does not damage tissue.

Because this ether has low solubility in water and high volatility, it quickly leaves the bloodstream once introduced. Because of these physical properties, a surgical patient can be brought into and out of general anesthesia (a state of unconsciousness) simply by regulating the gases breathed.
