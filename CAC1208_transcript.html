But when these monomers are chained together, they can form polymers consisting of hundreds of thousands of atoms per molecule. These large molecules are still too small to be seen with the unaided eye, but they're giants in the submicroscopic world. Here's an interesting way to visualize it: if a typical polymer molecule were as thick as a kite string, it would be 1 kilometer long!</p></div>

High-density polyethylene (HDPE) consists of long strands of straight-chain molecules packed closely together. The tight alignment of neighboring strands makes HDPE a relatively rigid, tough plastic that's useful for things like bottles and milk jugs.</p><br><p>On the other hand, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is made of strands with many branched chains, which prevents the strands from packing closely together. This makes LDPE more bendable than HDPE and gives it a lower melting point. While HDPE holds its shape in boiling water, LDPE deforms. LDPE is most useful for items like plastic bags, photographic film, and insulation for electric wire.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-14"><p>Let me explain that with polyethylene as our example. The monomer ethylene has a double bond between its carbon atoms. During polymerization, electrons from these double bonds split away and become unpaired valence electrons. Each unpaired electron then joins with an unpaired electron of a neighboring carbon atom to form a new covalent bond that links two monomer units together. This process continues, creating a long chain of linked monomers—the polymer.</p><br><p>Think of it like this: the double bond opens up, allowing each carbon to grab onto another monomer, and the chain grows longer and longer.</p></div>

In contrast to chlorine-containing Saran, fluorine-containing Teflon has a nonstick surface because the fluorine atoms tend not to experience molecular attractions. Additionally, because carbon–fluorine bonds are unusually strong, Teflon can be heated to high temperatures before decomposing, making it ideal for cooking surfaces. It's also relatively inert, which is why many corrosive chemicals are shipped or stored in Teflon containers.</p></div>

For example, take 6-aminohexanoic acid, which has two different reactive ends on the same molecule. Monomers of 6-aminohexanoic acid combine by splitting off water molecules to form the polymer known as nylon-6. This is a perfect example of how a single type of monomer with different reactive groups at each end can form a condensation polymer.</p></div>

PETE does contain ester linkages, but it also contains multiple benzene rings alongside those ester functional groups. Because these benzene rings are highly nonpolar, they effectively repel water molecules, which greatly inhibits any hydrolysis. So despite having ester linkages, PETE is not readily biodegradable.</p></div>

One solution is to build a polymer with ester linkages that looks much like PETE but has fewer benzene rings. This is the approach taken with polybutylene adipate co-terephthalate (PBAT).</p><br><p>First developed in the early 1990s, PBAT is now rapidly gaining in popularity as public awareness has risen and governmental regulations have been put into place. Consider the example of laying down a mulch film to prevent weeds in agricultural fields. A bio-based polymer might fall apart too quickly, while a traditional petrochemical polymer would have to be removed and landfilled after use. PBAT-based film, by contrast, can be mulched into the soil where it degrades in a timely manner.</p></div>

In the United States, synthetic polymers have actually surpassed steel as the most widely used material.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I had no idea plastics were more widely used than steel! What's the difference between addition polymers and condensation polymers?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Let's start with addition polymers. Addition polymers form simply by the joining together of monomer units. For this to happen, each monomer must contain at least one double bond. During polymerization, two of the electrons from each double bond split away from each other to form new covalent bonds with neighboring monomer molecules.\n\nAn important point about addition polymers: during this process, no atoms are lost. This means the total mass of an addition polymer is equal to the sum of the masses of all its monomers.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So if I had 100 grams of monomers, I'd get 100 grams of the addition polymer? No mass is lost?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's exactly right! The mass is conserved in addition polymerization since no atoms are lost in the process. Let's look at a common example: polyethylene. Over 22 million tons of polyethylene are produced annually in the United States\u2014that's about 130 pounds per U.S. citizen. It's synthesized from ethylene, which is an unsaturated hydrocarbon produced in large quantities from petroleum.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I think I've heard of polyethylene before. Isn't that what plastic bags are made of?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, but there are actually different types of polyethylene with different properties. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) consists of long strands of straight-chain molecules packed closely together. The tight alignment of neighboring strands makes HDPE a relatively rigid, tough plastic that's useful for things like bottles and milk jugs.\n\nOn the other hand, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is made of strands with many branched chains, which prevents the strands from packing closely together. This makes LDPE more bendable than HDPE and gives it a lower melting point. While HDPE holds its shape in boiling water, LDPE deforms. LDPE is most useful for items like plastic bags, photographic film, and insulation for electric wire.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's interesting! So the same basic polymer can have different properties based on how it's structured. But I'm still confused about how the monomers actually join together.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Let me explain that with polyethylene as our example. The monomer ethylene has a double bond between its carbon atoms. During polymerization, electrons from these double bonds split away and become unpaired valence electrons. Each unpaired electron then joins with an unpaired electron of a neighboring carbon atom to form a new covalent bond that links two monomer units together. This process continues, creating a long chain of linked monomers\u2014the polymer.\n\nThink of it like this: the double bond opens up, allowing each carbon to grab onto another monomer, and the chain grows longer and longer.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Oh, I think I get it now. The double bonds break and reform as single bonds that connect the monomers. Are there other addition polymers besides polyethylene?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Absolutely! Addition polymers can be created using many different monomers. The only requirement is that the monomer must contain a double bond (or triple bond).\n\nFor example, the monomer propylene yields polypropylene, which is a tough plastic material useful for pipes, hard-shell suitcases, and appliance parts. Fibers of polypropylene are also used for upholstery, indoor-outdoor carpet, and even thermal underwear.\n\nUsing styrene as the monomer yields polystyrene. Transparent plastic cups are made of polystyrene, as are thousands of other household items. When air is blown into liquid polystyrene, it creates Styrofoam\u2122, which is widely used for coffee cups, packing material, and insulation.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So I'm guessing polyvinyl chloride is another one? I've heard of PVC pipes.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's right! Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is another important addition polymer. It's tough and easily molded, which makes it perfect for floor tiles, shower curtains, and pipes as you mentioned.\n\nRigid polymers like PVC can be made soft by incorporating small molecules called plasticizers. Pure PVC is a tough material great for making pipes, but when mixed with a plasticizer, it becomes soft and flexible, making it useful for shower curtains, toys, and many other household products.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wait, I've heard something about plasticizers being dangerous. Is that true?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a thoughtful observation. One of the more commonly used types of plasticizers is the phthalates, some of which have been shown to disrupt the development of reproductive organs, especially in fetuses and in growing children. This is why governments and manufacturers are working to phase them out.\n\nHowever, not all phthalates are equally concerning. Some, such as DINP, have been shown to be much less dangerous. There's ongoing debate about whether all phthalates should be banned or just the ones proven to be harmful. This is a social and political question that has yet to be fully resolved.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's concerning. Are there other potentially problematic polymers I should know about?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Another example is polyvinylidene chloride, which was sold under the trade name Saran\u2122 and once used to make plastic wrap for food. The large chlorine atoms in this polymer help it stick to surfaces like glass through dipole-induced dipole attractions.\n\nHowever, due to environmental concerns, Saran\u2122 Wrap brand food wrap is now made from polyethylene instead. The original polyvinylidene chloride polymer contains twice the number of chlorine atoms as PVC and thus can transform into harmful dioxins when burned.\n\nOn a more positive note, the addition polymer polytetrafluoroethylene, which you know as Teflon\u00ae, has some unique properties. In contrast to chlorine-containing Saran, fluorine-containing Teflon has a nonstick surface because the fluorine atoms tend not to experience molecular attractions. Additionally, because carbon\u2013fluorine bonds are unusually strong, Teflon can be heated to high temperatures before decomposing, making it ideal for cooking surfaces. It's also relatively inert, which is why many corrosive chemicals are shipped or stored in Teflon containers.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Seems like all these addition polymers are really different, but they're all made the same way. What do all these monomers have in common again?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Great question for checking your understanding! All monomers used to make addition polymers have a multiple covalent bond between two carbon atoms\u2014typically a double bond. This double bond is what allows them to link together in the polymerization process.\n\nNow, let's move on to the second major type of polymers: condensation polymers.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": OK, so what makes condensation polymers different from addition polymers?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": A condensation polymer is formed when the joining of monomer units is accompanied by the loss of a small molecule, such as water or hydrochloric acid. This is the key difference from addition polymers where no atoms are lost.\n\nAny monomer capable of becoming part of a condensation polymer must have a functional group on each end. When two such monomers come together, one functional group of the first monomer links up with one functional group of the other monomer. The result is a two-monomer unit that has two terminal functional groups, one from each of the two original monomers. Each of these terminal functional groups is now free to link with a functional group of a third monomer, then a fourth, and so on. This is how the polymer chain is built.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So in condensation polymers, something small gets \"kicked out\" when the monomers join? And you need monomers with reactive groups on both ends?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's exactly right! A great example of a condensation polymer is nylon. Nylon is composed of two different monomers: adipic acid, which contains two reactive carboxyl groups, and hexamethylenediamine, which has two amine groups as the reactive end groups.\n\nWhen one end of an adipic acid molecule and one end of a hexamethylamine molecule react with each other, they split off a water molecule in the process. After these two monomers have joined, reactive ends still remain for further reactions, which leads to a growing polymer chain. Nylon is used in hosiery, ropes, parachutes, clothing, and carpets.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That makes sense. So you need something with reactive groups on both ends. Could you have both types of reactive groups on the same molecule?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's an excellent question! Yes, you absolutely can have both types of reactive groups on the same molecule. For example, take 6-aminohexanoic acid, which has two different reactive ends on the same molecule. Monomers of 6-aminohexanoic acid combine by splitting off water molecules to form the polymer known as nylon-6. This is a perfect example of how a single type of monomer with different reactive groups at each end can form a condensation polymer.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Are there other common condensation polymers I might encounter in everyday life?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Definitely! Another widely used condensation polymer is polyethylene terephthalate, or PET or PETE. It's formed from the polymerization of ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid. Plastic soda bottles are made from this polymer.\n\nPETE fibers are sold as Dacron\u2122 polyester, which is used in clothing and stuffing for pillows and sleeping bags. Thin films of PETE, called Mylar\u00ae, can be coated with metal particles to make magnetic recording tape or those metallic-looking balloons you see for sale at grocery store checkout counters.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I've seen those balloons! I had no idea they were made from polymers. What about those really hard plastics that don't seem to bend at all?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Those hard plastics are often made from monomers that contain three reactive functional groups. These can form polymer chains that become interlocked in a rigid 3-dimensional network, lending considerable strength and durability to the polymer.\n\nOnce formed, these condensation polymers cannot be remelted or reshaped, which makes them hard-set, or thermoset, polymers. Hard plastic dishes (Melmac\u2122) and countertops (Formica\u2122) are made of this material. A similar polymer, Bakelite\u2122, made from formaldehyde and phenols containing multiple oxygen atoms, is used to bind plywood and particleboard. Interestingly, Bakelite was synthesized in the early 1900s and was the first widely used polymer.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": This is all really interesting, but I've been hearing a lot about plastic pollution. Aren't all these polymers bad for the environment since they don't break down?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a very important environmental concern. All of the polymers we've discussed so far are created from petrochemicals, which are organic compounds isolated from fossil fuels. With the exception of PETE, the polymer chains consist of repeated carbon-carbon bonds, which gives them great structural integrity\u2014meaning materials built from these polymers hold up well for various uses.\n\nHowever, this same structural integrity means that the polymer does not readily break down. After being discarded, it can persist in the environment for centuries, which is problematic given the growing quantities of plastics we discard every year.\n\nRecycling is one solution, but despite public education efforts, less than 10% of all plastics get recycled. The bulk still end up within landfills. Furthermore, plastics, once recycled, do not hold up as well as fresh plastic.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That doesn't sound promising. Are there any alternatives being developed?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, there's growing research and development of biodegradable plastics from natural sources, such as lactic acid, which can be obtained from the fermentation of sugars. Examples include polylactic acid (PLA) and poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB).\n\nThe structural integrity of these bio-based plastics is not as strong as petrochemical plastics, but an environmentally-aware consumer can appreciate this as an advantage rather than a disadvantage. The chemistry-aware consumer will recognize that the monomers of these polymers are held together by ester linkages, which are relatively easy to break apart through hydrolysis\u2014a process where a water molecule attacks the ester.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wait, I'm confused. If esters break down easily with water, why don't all plastics with esters break down? Like that PETE you mentioned for soda bottles?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a very astute observation! PETE does contain ester linkages, but it also contains multiple benzene rings alongside those ester functional groups. Because these benzene rings are highly nonpolar, they effectively repel water molecules, which greatly inhibits any hydrolysis. So despite having ester linkages, PETE is not readily biodegradable.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So what's the solution? Can we make plastics that are strong but still break down?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's exactly what chemists are working on! One solution is to build a polymer with ester linkages that looks much like PETE but has fewer benzene rings. This is the approach taken with polybutylene adipate co-terephthalate (PBAT).\n\nFirst developed in the early 1990s, PBAT is now rapidly gaining in popularity as public awareness has risen and governmental regulations have been put into place. Consider the example of laying down a mulch film to prevent weeds in agricultural fields. A bio-based polymer might fall apart too quickly, while a traditional petrochemical polymer would have to be removed and landfilled after use. PBAT-based film, by contrast, can be mulched into the soil where it degrades in a timely manner.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That sounds like a good compromise. I'm guessing the polymer industry has grown a lot with all these different applications?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Absolutely! The synthetic polymer industry has grown remarkably. Annual production of polymers in the United States alone has grown from 3 billion pounds in 1950 to more than 100 billion pounds in 2020. Today, it's a challenge to find any consumer item that doesn't contain a plastic of one sort or another.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": What does the future look like for polymers? Are there new developments happening?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": The future of polymers is incredibly exciting! We can expect to see new kinds of polymers with a wide range of remarkable properties. We already have polymers that conduct electricity, others that emit light, others that replace body parts, and still others that are stronger but much lighter than steel.\n\nFor example, flexible and flat video displays known as OLEDs (organic light-emitting diodes) are now fabricated from polymers. Imagine synthetic polymers that mimic photosynthesis by transforming solar energy to chemical energy or that efficiently separate fresh water from ocean water. These aren't just dreams\u2014they're realities that chemists have already been demonstrating in the laboratory. Polymers hold a clear promise for the future.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wow, I had no idea chemistry could be so applicable to everyday life and the future. This actually makes me more interested in my science class now. I think I understand polymer chemistry much better than I expected to.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": I'm so glad to hear that!
