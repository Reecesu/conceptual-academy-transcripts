High-density polyethylene (HDPE) consists of long strands of straight-chain molecules packed closely together. The tight alignment of neighboring strands makes HDPE a relatively rigid, tough plastic that's useful for things like bottles and milk jugs.\n\nOn the other hand, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is made of strands with many branched chains, which prevents the strands from packing closely together. This makes LDPE more bendable than HDPE and gives it a lower melting point. While HDPE holds its shape in boiling water, LDPE deforms.

Each unpaired electron then joins with an unpaired electron of a neighboring carbon atom to form a new covalent bond that links two monomer units together. This process continues, creating a long chain of linked monomers—the polymer.\n\nThink of it like this: the double bond opens up, allowing each carbon to grab onto another monomer, and the chain grows longer and longer.",

Fibers of polypropylene are also used for upholstery, indoor-outdoor carpet, and even thermal underwear.\n\nUsing styrene as the monomer yields polystyrene.

The original polyvinylidene chloride polymer contains twice the number of chlorine atoms as PVC and thus can transform into harmful dioxins when burned.\n\nOn a more positive note, the addition polymer polytetrafluoroethylene, which you know as Teflon®, has some unique properties. In contrast to chlorine-containing Saran, fluorine-containing Teflon has a nonstick surface because the fluorine atoms tend not to experience molecular attractions. Additionally, because carbon–fluorine bonds are unusually strong, Teflon can be heated to high temperatures before decomposing, making it ideal for cooking surfaces. It's also relatively inert, which is why many corrosive chemicals are shipped or stored in Teflon containers.",

When two such monomers come together, one functional group of the first monomer links up with one functional group of the other monomer. The result is a two-monomer unit that has two terminal functional groups, one from each of the two original monomers. Each of these terminal functional groups is now free to link with a functional group of a third monomer, then a fourth, and so on. This is how the polymer chain is built.",

After these two monomers have joined, reactive ends still remain for further reactions, which leads to a growing polymer chain. Nylon is used in hosiery, ropes, parachutes, clothing, and carpets.",

Hard plastic dishes (Melmac™) and countertops (Formica™) are made of this material. A similar polymer, Bakelite™, made from formaldehyde and phenols containing multiple oxygen atoms, is used to bind plywood and particleboard.

With the exception of PETE, the polymer chains consist of repeated carbon-carbon bonds, which gives them great structural integrity—meaning materials built from these polymers hold up well for various uses.\n\nHowever, this same structural integrity means that the polymer does not readily break down. After being discarded, it can persist in the environment for centuries, which is problematic given the growing quantities of plastics we discard every year.\n\nRecycling is one solution, but despite public education efforts, less than 10% of all plastics get recycled. The bulk still end up within landfills. Furthermore, plastics, once recycled, do not hold up as well as fresh plastic.",

The chemistry-aware consumer will recognize that the monomers of these polymers are held together by ester linkages, which are relatively easy to break apart through hydrolysis—a process where a water molecule attacks the ester.",

Consider the example of laying down a mulch film to prevent weeds in agricultural fields. A bio-based polymer might fall apart too quickly, while a traditional petrochemical polymer would have to be removed and landfilled after use. PBAT-based film, by contrast, can be mulched into the soil where it degrades in a timely manner.",
