In the case of natural rubber, the polymer is polyisoprene, which is made from isoprene molecules joining together. In the 1700s, natural rubber was noted for its ability to rub off pencil marks, which is actually the origin of the term "rubber." However, natural rubber had few other uses because it turns gooey at warm temperatures and brittle at cold temperatures.</p></div>

When regular natural rubber is stretched, the individual polyisoprene strands slip past one another and the rubber stays stretched. But when vulcanized rubber is stretched, the sulfur crosslinks hold the strands together, allowing the rubber to return to its original shape. To help meet our growing demand for vulcanized rubber, the polymer of rubber (polyisoprene) is now also produced from petroleum.</p></div>

Now, let's move forward in our history. In 1845, as vulcanized rubber was becoming popular, an interesting accidental discovery happened. The Swiss chemistry professor Christian Schönbein wiped up a spilled mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids with a cotton rag that he then hung up to dry. Within a few minutes, the rag burst into flames and then vanished, leaving only a tiny bit of ash.</p></div>

Schönbein had accidentally discovered nitrocellulose, in which most of the hydroxyl groups in cellulose are bonded to nitrate groups. His attempts to market nitrocellulose as a smokeless gunpowder (called guncotton) were unsuccessful, mainly because of a number of lethal explosions at plants producing the material. However, researchers in France discovered that solvents such as diethyl ether and alcohol transformed nitrocellulose to a gel that could be molded into various shapes. This workable nitrocellulose material was dubbed collodion, and its first application was as a medical dressing for cuts.</p></div>

In 1870, John Hyatt, a young inventor from Albany, New York, discovered that collodion's moldable properties were vastly improved by using camphor as a solvent. This camphor-based nitrocellulose material was named celluloid, and it became the plastic of choice for the manufacture of many household items, such as combs and hair fasteners. In addition, thin transparent films of celluloid made excellent supports for photosensitive compounds, which was a boon to the photography industry and a first step in the development of motion pictures.</p><br><p>As wonderful as celluloid was, it still had the major drawback of being highly flammable. Today, one of the few commercially available products made of celluloid is Ping-Pong balls.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-28"><p>Yes, it was quite fortunate! With his newfound wealth, Baekeland explored a tar-like solid once produced in the laboratories of Alfred von Baeyer, the German chemist who played a role in the development of aspirin. Whereas Baeyer had dismissed the solid as worthless, Baekeland saw it as a virtual gold mine. After several years, he produced a resin that, when poured into a mold and then heated under pressure, solidified into a transparent positive of the mold. Baekeland's resin was a mixture of formaldehyde and a phenol that polymerized into a complex network.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-30"><p>That's a fair question. The solidified material, which he called Bakelite, was remarkable because it was impervious to harsh acids or bases, wide temperature extremes, and just about any solvent. Unlike celluloid, it wasn't flammable. Bakelite quickly replaced celluloid as a molding medium, finding a wide variety of uses for several decades. The first handset telephones were made of Bakelite. It wasn't until the 1930s that alternative thermoset polymers began to challenge Bakelite's dominance in the evolving plastics industry.</p></div>

Extruding the viscose into an acidic solution generated a tough cellulose filament that could be used to make a synthetic silky cloth today called rayon.</p></div>

The connection to cellophane came in 1904, when Jacques Brandenberger, a Swiss textile chemist, observed restaurant workers discarding fine tablecloths that had only slight stains on them. Working with viscose at the time, he had the idea of extruding it not as a fiber, but as a thin, transparent sheet that might be adhered to tablecloths and provide an easy-to-clean surface. By 1913, Brandenberger had perfected the manufacture of a viscose-derived, thin, transparent sheet of cellulose, which he named cellophane.</p></div>

With properties such as these, cellophane played a great role in the success of supermarkets, which first appeared in the 1930s.</p></div>

In the 1930s, more than 90 percent of the natural rubber used in the United States came from Malaysia. In the days after Pearl Harbor was attacked in December 1941 and the United States entered World War II, however, Japan captured Malaysia. As a result, the United States—the land with plenty of everything, except rubber—faced its first natural resource crisis.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-42"><p>Exactly. The military implications were devastating, because without rubber for tires, military airplanes and jeeps were useless. Petroleum-based synthetic rubber had been developed in 1930 by Du Pont chemist Wallace Carothers but was not widely used because it was much more expensive than natural rubber. With Malaysian rubber impossible to get and a war on, however, cost was no longer an issue. Synthetic rubber factories were constructed across the nation, and within a few years, the annual production of synthetic rubber rose from 2000 tons to about 800,000 tons.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-44"><p>It certainly is! Another example from that era involves radar technology. In the 1930s, British scientists developed radar as a way to track thunderstorms. With war approaching, these scientists turned their attention to the idea that military planes could be equipped with radar. To make the radar equipment light enough to fly on an airplane, however, they needed the wires of the device coated with some sort of electrical insulator. Fortunately, the polymer polyethylene, recently developed in Britain, turned out to be an ideal electrical insulator. The radar-equipped planes were slow, but flying at night or in poor weather, they could detect, intercept, and destroy enemy aircraft.</p></div>

Known to chemists as poly(methyl methacrylate), this glass-like but moldable and lightweight material made excellent domes for the gunner's nests on fighter planes and bombers. The bulky side groups in poly(methyl methacrylate) prevent the polymer chains from aligning with one another. This makes it easy for light to pass through the material, which is tough, transparent, lightweight, and moldable.

Originally designed as a covering to protect theater seats from chewing gum, Saran found great use in World War II as a protective wrapping for artillery equipment during sea voyages. Before Saran, the standard operating procedure had been to disassemble and grease the artillery to avoid corrosion. After the war, this polymer soon pushed cellophane aside to become the most popular food wrap of all time. Because of environmental issues associated with Saran, polyethylene now holds the title of most widely used food wrap.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-56"><p>Your observation about your mother is spot on - "Saran wrap" became a generic term for plastic wrap in many households, similar to how people might say "Kleenex" for any facial tissue. Regarding environmental concerns, traditional Saran wrap contained polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), which can release dioxins when incinerated. This led to reformulations and alternatives like polyethylene being preferred.</p><br><p>Now, let's talk about one more remarkable wartime polymer: Teflon. In the late 1930s, the discoverers of Teflon were impressed by the long list of things this new material would not do. It would not burn, and it would not completely melt. Instead, at 620°F it congealed into a gel that could be conveniently molded. It would not conduct electricity, and it was impervious to attack by mold or fungus. No solvent, acid, or base could dissolve or corrode it. And most remarkably, nothing would stick to it, not even chewing gum.</p></div>

Thus, Teflon found its first application, and one year later, World War II came to a close with the nuclear bombing of Japan.</p></div>

With petroleum so readily available and inexpensive, however, and with a growing population of plastic-dependent baby boomers, little stood in the way of an ever-expanding array of plastic consumer products. By 1977, plastics surpassed steel as the number-one material produced in the United States.</p></div>

I'm Alia, and I'm here to support the learning of core science concepts. Let's get started. How can I help you today?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Hi Alia. I need to learn about plastics for my general science course. I've always struggled with chemistry in high school and usually avoided science classes when I could. But I'm trying to be more open-minded in college.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": I'm glad you're exploring science with an open mind! I'd be happy to help you learn about plastics. Let's start with a brief history of plastics, which is a fascinating journey through human innovation. Would you like to begin there?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Sure, that sounds good. I guess I never really thought about where plastics came from originally.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": The search for a lightweight, non-breakable, moldable material began with the invention of vulcanized rubber. This material is derived from natural rubber, which is a semisolid, elastic, natural polymer. The fundamental chemical unit of natural rubber is polyisoprene, which plants produce from isoprene molecules.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wait, so rubber is actually a polymer? I thought polymers were just plastics.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a common misconception! Natural rubber is indeed a polymer. A polymer is simply a large molecule made up of repeating subunits. In the case of natural rubber, the polymer is polyisoprene, which is made from isoprene molecules joining together. In the 1700s, natural rubber was noted for its ability to rub off pencil marks, which is actually the origin of the term \"rubber.\" However, natural rubber had few other uses because it turns gooey at warm temperatures and brittle at cold temperatures.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Oh, that makes sense why it's called rubber! But if it gets sticky when warm and brittle when cold, I can see why that would be a problem for most uses.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Exactly! Those temperature limitations were a significant challenge. That's where Charles Goodyear comes into the story. In 1839, this American inventor discovered rubber vulcanization, a process in which natural rubber and sulfur are heated together. The product, vulcanized rubber, is harder than natural rubber and retains its elastic properties over a wide range of temperatures.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Is that the same Goodyear as the tire company?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Good question! Charles Goodyear was the classic eccentric inventor. He lived most of his life in poverty, obsessed with transforming rubber into a useful material. Goodyear was a man of ill health who died in debt, yet he remained stubbornly optimistic. Interestingly, the present-day Goodyear Corporation was founded not by Goodyear himself, but by others who sought to pay tribute to his name 15 years after he died.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's kind of sad that he never got to see his name become so famous. So what makes vulcanized rubber different from regular rubber?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": The key difference is in the molecular structure. Vulcanization results in disulfide cross-linking between polymer chains. When regular natural rubber is stretched, the individual polyisoprene strands slip past one another and the rubber stays stretched. But when vulcanized rubber is stretched, the sulfur crosslinks hold the strands together, allowing the rubber to return to its original shape. To help meet our growing demand for vulcanized rubber, the polymer of rubber (polyisoprene) is now also produced from petroleum.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Oh, I think I get it. So the sulfur creates links between the chains that act like... hmm, maybe like little springs that pull everything back to shape?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's an excellent analogy! The sulfur cross-links do function like tiny molecular springs that help the material return to its original shape. Now, let's move forward in our history. In 1845, as vulcanized rubber was becoming popular, an interesting accidental discovery happened. The Swiss chemistry professor Christian Sch\u00f6nbein wiped up a spilled mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids with a cotton rag that he then hung up to dry. Within a few minutes, the rag burst into flames and then vanished, leaving only a tiny bit of ash.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Whoa! That sounds dangerous. What happened there?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Indeed it was dangerous! Sch\u00f6nbein had accidentally discovered nitrocellulose, in which most of the hydroxyl groups in cellulose are bonded to nitrate groups. His attempts to market nitrocellulose as a smokeless gunpowder (called guncotton) were unsuccessful, mainly because of a number of lethal explosions at plants producing the material. However, researchers in France discovered that solvents such as diethyl ether and alcohol transformed nitrocellulose to a gel that could be molded into various shapes. This workable nitrocellulose material was dubbed collodion, and its first application was as a medical dressing for cuts.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I'm getting a bit confused with all these chemical names. So cotton plus acids created a material that explodes, but then they found a way to make it safer by adding other chemicals?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": You're on the right track. Cotton is mostly cellulose - a natural polymer. When treated with those strong acids, it forms nitrocellulose, which is highly combustible because of its many nitrate groups that facilitate oxidation. And yes, by dissolving it in certain solvents, they created a more stable, workable material called collodion. This was a critical step toward developing early plastics.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Is nitrocellulose still used for anything today? It sounds pretty dangerous.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Good question! In 1870, John Hyatt, a young inventor from Albany, New York, discovered that collodion's moldable properties were vastly improved by using camphor as a solvent. This camphor-based nitrocellulose material was named celluloid, and it became the plastic of choice for the manufacture of many household items, such as combs and hair fasteners. In addition, thin transparent films of celluloid made excellent supports for photosensitive compounds, which was a boon to the photography industry and a first step in the development of motion pictures.\n\nAs wonderful as celluloid was, it still had the major drawback of being highly flammable. Today, one of the few commercially available products made of celluloid is Ping-Pong balls.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wait, Ping-Pong balls are flammable? I had no idea!", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": They certainly are! If you smell a freshly cut Ping-Pong ball, you would note the distinct odor of camphor, which is the same smell that arises from heat cream for sore muscles. This camphor comes from the celluloid from which the ball is made. And yes, Ping-Pong balls burn rapidly because they are made of nitrocellulose. The flammability of celluloid actually has a historical connection to movie theaters.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": What's the connection to movie theaters?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Well, early motion picture film was made from celluloid, which as we've discussed, is highly flammable. There were numerous devastating fires in movie theaters when the film would catch fire from the hot projection lamps. This led to strict fire safety regulations and is one reason why modern theaters have so many exits. It's a direct result of those early celluloid film dangers!", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I never thought about why theaters have so many exits! That makes sense now. So what came after celluloid?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": The next major development was Bakelite, which became the first widely used plastic. Around 1899, Leo Baekeland, a chemist who had immigrated to the United States from Belgium, developed an emulsion for photographic paper that was exceptional in its sensitivity to light. He sold his invention to George Eastman, who had made a fortune selling celluloid-based photographic film along with his portable Kodak camera.\n\nExpecting no more than $50,000 for his invention, Baekeland was shocked at Eastman's initial offer of $750,000 (in today's dollars, that would be about $25 million). Suddenly a very wealthy man, Baekeland was free to pursue his chemical interests.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wow, that's a lot of money, especially back then! Lucky guy.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, it was quite fortunate! With his newfound wealth, Baekeland explored a tar-like solid once produced in the laboratories of Alfred von Baeyer, the German chemist who played a role in the development of aspirin. Whereas Baeyer had dismissed the solid as worthless, Baekeland saw it as a virtual gold mine. After several years, he produced a resin that, when poured into a mold and then heated under pressure, solidified into a transparent positive of the mold. Baekeland's resin was a mixture of formaldehyde and a phenol that polymerized into a complex network.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I'm getting a bit lost in the chemistry again. How was Bakelite different from the earlier materials?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a fair question. The solidified material, which he called Bakelite, was remarkable because it was impervious to harsh acids or bases, wide temperature extremes, and just about any solvent. Unlike celluloid, it wasn't flammable. Bakelite quickly replaced celluloid as a molding medium, finding a wide variety of uses for several decades. The first handset telephones were made of Bakelite. It wasn't until the 1930s that alternative thermoset polymers began to challenge Bakelite's dominance in the evolving plastics industry.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Oh, I think I've seen those old phones in antique shops! They're really heavy and solid.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Exactly! Those classic phones are perfect examples of early Bakelite applications. Now, let's move on to another important development in the history of plastics: cellophane, which was the first plastic wrap.\n\nCellophane had its beginnings in 1892, when Charles Cross and Edward Bevan of England found that treating cellulose with concentrated sodium hydroxide followed by carbon disulfide created a thick, syrupy yellow liquid they called viscose. Extruding the viscose into an acidic solution generated a tough cellulose filament that could be used to make a synthetic silky cloth today called rayon.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Rayon? I think I have clothes made of rayon. I had no idea it was related to the same stuff as plastic wrap!", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, rayon is still used today in textiles! The connection to cellophane came in 1904, when Jacques Brandenberger, a Swiss textile chemist, observed restaurant workers discarding fine tablecloths that had only slight stains on them. Working with viscose at the time, he had the idea of extruding it not as a fiber, but as a thin, transparent sheet that might be adhered to tablecloths and provide an easy-to-clean surface. By 1913, Brandenberger had perfected the manufacture of a viscose-derived, thin, transparent sheet of cellulose, which he named cellophane.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's pretty clever! So he was trying to make tablecloths easier to clean and ended up inventing plastic wrap instead?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's right! It's a wonderful example of innovation coming from trying to solve a practical everyday problem. Within several years, the Du Pont Corporation bought the rights to cellophane. Hermetically sealed by cellophane, a product could be kept free of dust and germs. And unlike paper or tin foil\u2014the alternatives of the day\u2014cellophane was transparent and thus allowed the consumer to view the packaged contents. With properties such as these, cellophane played a great role in the success of supermarkets, which first appeared in the 1930s.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I never thought about how being able to see the product would affect shopping.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Indeed! Perhaps cellophane's greatest appeal to the consumer was its shine. As marketing people soon discovered, nearly any product\u2014soaps, canned goods, and golf balls\u2014would sell faster when wrapped in cellophane. The visual appeal significantly impacted consumer behavior.\n\nNow, let's move on to how polymers played a crucial role in World War II, which was a pivotal time for the development of plastic materials.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I wouldn't have expected plastics to be important in a war. I guess for like, equipment cases or something?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": You'd be surprised at how vital plastics became during the war! In the 1930s, more than 90 percent of the natural rubber used in the United States came from Malaysia. In the days after Pearl Harbor was attacked in December 1941 and the United States entered World War II, however, Japan captured Malaysia. As a result, the United States\u2014the land with plenty of everything, except rubber\u2014faced its first natural resource crisis.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Oh, I see. So they couldn't get rubber for tires and other military equipment?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Exactly. The military implications were devastating, because without rubber for tires, military airplanes and jeeps were useless. Petroleum-based synthetic rubber had been developed in 1930 by Du Pont chemist Wallace Carothers but was not widely used because it was much more expensive than natural rubber. With Malaysian rubber impossible to get and a war on, however, cost was no longer an issue. Synthetic rubber factories were constructed across the nation, and within a few years, the annual production of synthetic rubber rose from 2000 tons to about 800,000 tons.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's a massive increase! I guess necessity really is the mother of invention.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": It certainly is! Another example from that era involves radar technology. In the 1930s, British scientists developed radar as a way to track thunderstorms. With war approaching, these scientists turned their attention to the idea that military planes could be equipped with radar. To make the radar equipment light enough to fly on an airplane, however, they needed the wires of the device coated with some sort of electrical insulator. Fortunately, the polymer polyethylene, recently developed in Britain, turned out to be an ideal electrical insulator. The radar-equipped planes were slow, but flying at night or in poor weather, they could detect, intercept, and destroy enemy aircraft.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So polymers were actually crucial to winning the war. That's pretty amazing. What other plastics were important during World War II?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Several other polymers had a significant impact on the outcome of World War II, including Nylon\u00ae, Plexiglas\u00ae, PVC, Saran\u2122, and Teflon\u00ae. Nylon was invented in 1937 and found great use in the manufacture of ropes, parachutes, and clothing. Interestingly, tear-resistant Nylon stockings, which had just been introduced, were extremely popular during the war and often used as a commodity for favors or to repay debts among soldiers.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wait, nylon stockings were used as currency? That's wild!", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, it's a fascinating bit of social history! Plexiglas is another polymer that was crucial during the war. Known to chemists as poly(methyl methacrylate), this glass-like but moldable and lightweight material made excellent domes for the gunner's nests on fighter planes and bombers. The bulky side groups in poly(methyl methacrylate) prevent the polymer chains from aligning with one another. This makes it easy for light to pass through the material, which is tough, transparent, lightweight, and moldable. Today, you might recognize it from sneeze-guards that became popular during the COVID pandemic.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Oh, I've definitely seen those sneeze guards everywhere! I'm starting to see how plastics really are in everything around us.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": They certainly are ubiquitous in our modern world. Let's continue with some of the other important wartime polymers. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) had been developed by a number of chemical companies in the 1920s. The problem with this material, however, was that it lost resiliency when heated. In 1929, Waldo Semon, a chemist at BFGoodrich, found that PVC could be made into a workable material by the addition of a plasticizer.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": What's a plasticizer?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": A plasticizer is a substance added to a material to make it more flexible, resilient, and easier to handle. Semon got the idea of using plasticized PVC as a shower curtain when he observed his wife sewing together a shower curtain made of rubberized cotton. Other uses for PVC were slow to appear, however, and it wasn't until World War II that this material became recognized as an ideal waterproof material for tents and rain gear. After the war, PVC replaced Bakelite as the medium for making phonograph records.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I think my dad collects vinyl records. So those are made of PVC? I'm connecting so many dots now.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's right! \"Vinyl\" records are indeed made of PVC (polyvinyl chloride). That's a great connection! Another wartime polymer was Saran. Originally designed as a covering to protect theater seats from chewing gum, Saran found great use in World War II as a protective wrapping for artillery equipment during sea voyages. Before Saran, the standard operating procedure had been to disassemble and grease the artillery to avoid corrosion. After the war, this polymer soon pushed cellophane aside to become the most popular food wrap of all time. Because of environmental issues associated with Saran, polyethylene now holds the title of most widely used food wrap.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I think my mom still calls plastic wrap \"Saran wrap\" even when it's not that brand. What environmental issues does it have?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Your observation about your mother is spot on - \"Saran wrap\" became a generic term for plastic wrap in many households, similar to how people might say \"Kleenex\" for any facial tissue. Regarding environmental concerns, traditional Saran wrap contained polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), which can release dioxins when incinerated. This led to reformulations and alternatives like polyethylene being preferred.\n\nNow, let's talk about one more remarkable wartime polymer: Teflon. In the late 1930s, the discoverers of Teflon were impressed by the long list of things this new material would not do. It would not burn, and it would not completely melt. Instead, at 620\u00b0F it congealed into a gel that could be conveniently molded. It would not conduct electricity, and it was impervious to attack by mold or fungus. No solvent, acid, or base could dissolve or corrode it. And most remarkably, nothing would stick to it, not even chewing gum.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's the stuff on non-stick pans, right? I had no idea it went back that far!", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, that's exactly right! Because of all the things Teflon would not do, DuPont was not quite sure what to do with it at first. Then in 1944, the company was approached by governmental researchers in desperate need of a highly inert material to line the valves and ducts of an apparatus being built to isolate uranium-235 in the manufacture of the first nuclear bomb. Thus, Teflon found its first application, and one year later, World War II came to a close with the nuclear bombing of Japan.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Let me see if I can name all the polymers you mentioned that were important in World War II: synthetic rubber, polyethylene for radar insulation, nylon for parachutes, Plexiglas for airplane gunner domes, PVC for waterproof gear, Saran for protecting artillery, and Teflon for... making atomic bombs? Did I miss any?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Excellent recall! You've named them all correctly. To recap: synthetic rubber, polyethylene, Nylon, Plexiglas, PVC, Saran, and Teflon all had significant impacts on the effectiveness of Allied forces in World War II.\n\nNow, let's discuss how attitudes about plastics have changed over time. With a record of wartime successes, plastics were readily embraced in the postwar years. In the 1950s, Dacron polyester was introduced as a substitute for wool. Also, the 1950s were the decade during which the entrepreneur Earl Tupper created a line of polyethylene food containers, known as Tupperware\u00ae.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Oh, Tupperware!

By the 1960s, a decade of environmental awakening, many people began to recognize the negative attributes of plastics. Being inexpensive, disposable, and non-biodegradable, plastic readily accumulated as litter and as landfill. With petroleum so readily available and inexpensive, however, and with a growing population of plastic-dependent baby boomers, little stood in the way of an ever-expanding array of plastic consumer products.
