Extruding the viscose into an acidic solution generated a tough cellulose filament that could be used to make a synthetic silky cloth today called rayon.",

Being inexpensive, disposable, and non-biodegradable, plastic readily accumulated as litter and as landfill. With petroleum so readily available and inexpensive, however, and with a growing population of plastic-dependent baby boomers, little stood in the way of an ever-expanding array of plastic consumer products. By 1977, plastics surpassed steel as the number-one material produced in the United States.",

Some 40 years later, however, still less than 10 percent of plastics are recycled. Our attitudes toward plastics have certainly changed over the years—one might argue from excitement to fear to boredom. Given the nature of plastics themselves, one might also argue that each of these attitudes is warranted.",

I think I understand now how polymers developed from natural materials like rubber and cellulose into the synthetic materials we use today, and how their properties make them both incredibly useful and problematic.",
