      "content": ": I'm glad you're taking this step! Carbohydrates are a fascinating topic and very relevant to our daily lives. Let's explore what carbohydrates are and their importance.\n\nCarbohydrates are organic molecules produced by photosynthetic plants, containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The term carbohydrate comes from the fact that plants make these molecules from carbon (from atmospheric carbon dioxide) and water. A synonym for carbohydrate is saccharide.",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's a great connection! Yes, plants are our primary source of carbohydrates. The fundamental carbohydrate unit is called a monosaccharide, which means \"one saccharide.\" In most monosaccharides, each carbon atom is bonded to at least one oxygen atom, most often within a hydroxyl group.\n\nThere are many kinds of monosaccharides, but the two most common ones are glucose and fructose. Honey, for example, is a mixture of these two monosaccharides. Glucose has a six-membered ring structure, while fructose has a five-membered ring.",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": ": Wait, so sugar molecules actually look like rings? I always thought they were just, I don't know, little balls or something. And honey is made of these ring-shaped molecules?",
      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes, that's correct! The molecular structures of glucose and fructose indeed form rings. Glucose has a six-membered ring, and fructose has a five-membered ring. And you're right about honey - it's naturally composed of these monosaccharides.\n\nMonosaccharides are also the building blocks of disaccharides, which are carbohydrate molecules containing two monosaccharide units linked together. Table sugar, or sucrose, is probably the best-known disaccharide. In our digestive tract, sucrose is readily cleaved, or separated, into its monosaccharide units: glucose and fructose.",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "user",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Exactly right! When you consume table sugar (sucrose), your digestive system breaks it down into glucose and fructose. This process happens with other disaccharides too.\n\nFor instance, lactose is another important disaccharide. It's the main carbohydrate in milk and is cleaved into the monosaccharides galactose and glucose by the enzyme lactase. Most children produce this enzyme in abundance up to about age 6. After that, the production of lactase often decreases, with the result that some adults produce little or none.",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's precisely right! Lactose intolerance occurs when people don't produce enough lactase enzyme to break down the lactose in milk products. When lactose isn't properly digested, certain intestinal bacteria vigorously digest it instead, generating large amounts of gases like hydrogen. This leads to symptoms like bloating, flatulence, and painful cramps.\n\nTo relieve these symptoms, some milk products are treated with Acidophilus bifidus, a strain of bacteria that destroys gas-causing bacteria in the digestive tract. Some lactose-intolerant individuals also add commercially available lactase enzyme to milk or milk products before consuming them.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": You've got it! Monosaccharides and disaccharides are classified as simple carbohydrates. The word \"simple\" is used because these food molecules consist of only one or two monosaccharide units. Most simple carbohydrates have some degree of sweetness and are also known as sugars.\n\nNow, let's move on to polysaccharides, which are complex carbohydrates.",

In this case, monosaccharides are the monomers that link to form biomolecular polymers called polysaccharides, which contain hundreds to thousands of monosaccharide units.\n\nPolysaccharides can be built from any type of monosaccharide units. For example, our bone joints are lubricated by the polysaccharide hyaluronic acid, which consists of alternating glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Absolutely! The exoskeletons (protective shells) of insects and some marine organisms, such as crabs and shrimp, are made of chitin, pronounced \"kite-in.\" Chitin is a hard, resilient polysaccharide made of the monosaccharide N-acetylglucosamine. In fact, the wood varnish known as shellac contains the chitin from the exoskeletons of insects. In powdered form, chitin is now finding use as a dietary fiber supplement.\n\nAlthough a polysaccharide can be made of any type of monosaccharide unit, the polysaccharides in the human diet are made only of glucose. These polysaccharides include starch, glycogen, and cellulose, which differ from one another only in the way the glucose units are connected together.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's a great question for checking your understanding! We refer to a carbohydrate as simple when it consists of only one or two monosaccharide units per molecule. Complex carbohydrates consist of large numbers of monosaccharide units per molecule. So yes, it's primarily about the number of monosaccharide units linked together.\n\nLet's talk about starch, an important polysaccharide in our diet.",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Correct! Starch is a polysaccharide produced by plants to store the abundance of glucose formed during photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert solar energy to the chemical energy of sugar molecules. On cloudy days or at night, the breakdown of starch polymers to glucose gives the plant a constant energy supply.\n\nAnimals, including humans, can also obtain glucose from plant starch, which makes plant starch an all-important food source. Most plants store the starch they produce either in their seeds or in their roots.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": At the molecular level, plants produce two forms of starch: amylose and amylopectin. In amylose, the glucose units are linked together in unbranched chains that coil. In amylopectin, the glucose units are linked together in coiling chains that branch periodically.\n\nThe starch of most starchy foods, such as bread and potatoes, is about 20 percent amylose and 80 percent amylopectin. As these foods are digested, glucose units are broken off the ends of the chains.",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's an insightful question! Indeed, there is a difference in how quickly these starches are digested. Because of its branching structure, amylopectin has more ends than amylose does. Therefore, amylopectin releases glucose units at a faster rate than amylose does during digestion.",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": ": I think I get it. Since amylopectin has more branches, it has more \"endpoints\" where digestion can happen simultaneously, so glucose is released faster?",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Exactly right! There is more branching in amylopectin and therefore a greater number of ends per molecule. The digestion of amylopectin produces more glucose molecules at a faster rate and therefore is a quicker and more immediate supply of glucose.\n\nNow, let's talk about how animals, including humans, store glucose.",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": You're absolutely right! Animals store their excess glucose by converting it to glycogen, a polymer made of hundreds of glucose monomers. It's sometimes referred to as \"animal starch.\" Glycogen has a structure much like that of amylopectin but with a greater extent of branching.\n\nBetween meals, when glucose levels drop, the body metabolizes glycogen to glucose. Glycogen therefore serves as our glucose reserve. Most of this glycogen is stored in our livers and muscle tissue.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes, cellulose is another important polysaccharide. It's a structural component of plant cell walls and, like starch and glycogen, is also a polysaccharide of glucose. However, the glucose in cellulose is slightly different from the glucose in starch and glycogen.\n\nThe glucose in cellulose is identical to the glucose in starch except for the orientation of one hydroxyl group. Because this particular hydroxyl group is involved in the joining of glucose monomers, the way in which the glucose units join together is affected.",

      "feedback": null

    {
      "role": "user",

      "image_summary": false,
      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": It absolutely does! That small difference has major structural implications. The glucose units of starch and glycogen are connected by what is called an alpha (α) linkage, which results in a coiling of the polysaccharide strand. The glucose units of cellulose are connected by a beta (β) linkage, which results in straight, uncoiled, unbranched chains.\n\nThese two attributes of cellulose molecules allow the polysaccharide strands to align much like strands of uncooked spaghetti. This alignment maximizes the number of hydrogen bonds between strands, which makes cellulose a tough material. Plants produce microscopic cellulose fibers in a crisscross fashion, increasing their structural strength.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's exactly right! Cellulose serves as the primary structural component of all plants. Cotton is nearly pure cellulose. Wood, made largely of cellulose, can support trees that are as much as 30 meters tall. In fact, cellulose is by far the most abundant organic compound on Earth.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's an excellent question! Most animals, including humans, are not able to break down cellulose into its monomer units, glucose. Instead, the cellulose in the food we eat serves as dietary fiber that helps in regulating bowel movements. In the large intestine, cellulose-based fiber absorbs water and has a laxative effect. Waste products are therefore moved along faster and, with them, harmful bacteria and toxins, including carcinogens.\n\nInterestingly, microorganisms that live in the digestive tracts of wood-eating termites and grass-eating ruminants, such as cattle, sheep, and goats, can break down cellulose to glucose. Strictly speaking, termites and ruminants do not digest cellulose. Rather, they digest the glucose produced by the cellulose-digesting microorganisms that live inside them.",
