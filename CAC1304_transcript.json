The shape of the alpha helix is maintained by hydrogen bonds between successive turns of the spiral. Proteins containing many alpha helices, such as wool, can be stretched because of the springlike properties of the alpha helix.\n\nThe pleated-sheet version forms when predominantly nonpolar amino acids, such as phenylalanine and valine, are grouped together. Proteins containing many pleated sheets, such as silk, are strong and flexible but not easily stretched.\n\nIt's important to note that secondary structure can vary from one portion of a polypeptide chain to another.

Also important are ionic bonds (also known as salt bridges) that occur between oppositely charged ions. Hydrogen bonding between side groups can also contribute to tertiary structure, as can induced dipole–induced dipole attractions between nonpolar side groups, such as those found in phenylalanine and valine.

Hydrophilic (water-loving) attractions between a protein and an aqueous medium, such as cytoplasm or blood, also help maintain tertiary structure.\n\nIn a protein dissolved in an aqueous medium, the polypeptide chain is folded in a compact way so that nonpolar side groups (which don't interact well with water) are on the inside of the molecule, and polar side groups (which do interact well with water) are on the outside, where they interact with the water.

The strength of keratin is established primarily by a number of crosslinks between adjacent alpha helices. In general, thick hair has more disulfide crosslinks than does fine hair.

This is usually a smelly step, because some of the sulfur is reduced to odorous hydrogen sulfide. Cleaving disulfide crosslinks allows the keratin to become more flexible.\n\nThe hair is then set into the desired shape, using rollers if the desired shape is curls or a flat surface if the desired shape is straight.

As water molecules slip between the alpha helices, the polypeptide strands slide past one another to the extent permitted by the disulfide crosslinks.\n\nAs water molecules evaporate, hydrogen bonds between alpha helices are reestablished, and the hair toughens to its original shape—unless, of course, the hair is mechanically held in a different shape by, for example, rollers. Hair fashioned by wetting maintains its new shape only temporarily, however, because disulfide crosslinks ultimately pull the hair back to its natural look.\n\nInterestingly, a small amount of water in hair enhances the molecular attractions between alpha helices.

Some of these sites, called receptor sites, are special in that reactant molecules, called substrates, are able to fit inside them. Like a hand in a glove, a substrate molecule must have the right shape in order to fit a receptor site.\n\nMolecular attractions, such as hydrogen bonding, then hold the substrate molecule in the receptor site in an optimal position for reacting.

Once sucrose binds to the empty receptor site on the sucrase, the enzyme facilitates the breaking of the covalent bond that links the glucose and fructose units together.\n\nIt does so by holding the sucrose molecule in a certain conformation and then changing the electronic characteristics of this covalent bond so that it breaks easily when attacked by water molecules.

Once the enzyme produces a sufficient concentration of product, it begins to shut down because the product molecules function as inhibitors.

      "content": ": Here's a summary of what we've covered about proteins:\n\n1. Proteins are large polymeric biomolecules made of amino acid monomers.\n2. There are 20 different amino acids that differ in their side groups.\n3. Amino acids link together through peptide bonds formed in condensation reactions.\n4. Proteins have four levels of structure:\n   - Primary: The sequence of amino acids\n   - Secondary: Local formations like alpha helices and pleated sheets\n   - Tertiary: The overall 3D shape of the entire polypeptide\n   - Quaternary: How multiple polypeptide chains arrange together\n\n5. Protein structure is maintained by various bonds and attractions:\n   - Disulfide bonds\n   - Ionic bonds/salt bridges\n   - Hydrogen bonds\n   - Hydrophobic interactions\n\n6. Proteins can be:\n   - Globular (compact, water-soluble)\n   - Fibrous (elongated, water-insoluble, like keratin in hair)\n\n7. Proteins can be denatured by changes in temperature, pH, or other conditions.\n\n8. Enzymes are special proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions:\n   - They have specific receptor sites for substrate molecules\n   - They dramatically increase reaction rates\n   - Their activity can be regulated by inhibitors\n\nDoes this summary help solidify the main concepts?",
