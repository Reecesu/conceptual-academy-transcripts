DNA is the primary source of genetic information in plants and animals and is found in the cell nucleus as well as in certain organelles known as mitochondria.\n\nIn RNA nucleotides, the ribose has an oxygen atom on each carbon atom of the ribose.

      "content": ": Yes! Science often progresses in unexpected ways. From Mendel's work arose the idea that heritable traits are passed from parents to offspring in discrete units called genes. In the early 1900s, researchers correlated Mendel's heritable genes to cellular microstructures known as chromosomes, which are elongated bundles of DNA and protein that form whenever a cell is getting ready to divide. Each gene, it was found, resides at a specific location on a particular chromosome. Offspring inherit genes by receiving replicates of their parents' chromosomes.",

In fact, up until the 1940s, it was not known whether the DNA portion or the protein portion of the chromosomes was the carrier of genetic information. Most investigators were inclined to believe that proteins, with their great diversity, were the carriers.",

      "content": ": In the 1940s, DNA was found to be a polymer containing adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. Along the DNA chain, these bases could be sorted in any order. This potential variability in base sequencing opened up the possibility that DNA was the carrier of genetic information.\n\nThe real breakthrough came in 1953, when James Watson, an American biologist, and Francis Crick, a British biophysicist, together deduced that DNA occurs as two separate strands of nucleotides coiled around each other in a double helix. The strands are held together by hydrogen bonding between opposing nitrogenous bases.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Not at all - and that's what was most critical about Watson and Crick's model. Hydrogen bonding occurs only between specific basesâ€”guanine pairs only with cytosine and adenine pairs only with thymine. This means that if you know the sequence of one strand, you can automatically deduce the sequence of the second strand, also known as the complementary strand.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's a crucial question. In living tissue, cells divide to create duplicates of themselves. In a maturing organism, cells divide frequently to provide growth. In a mature organism, cells divide at a rate sufficient for the replacement of those that die. Each time a cell divides, genetic information must be preserved.\n\nIn a process called replication, DNA strands are duplicated so that each newly formed cell receives a copy. Replication also allows copies of DNA to pass from parent to offspring.",

Each single strand then serves as a template for the synthesis of its complementary strand. Free nucleotides are coupled to the single strand of DNA according to the rules of base pairing: guanine + cytosine, adenine + thymine. One double helix thus turns into two. As a cell divides, one of the two new strands is segregated in each of the two newly formed cells.",
