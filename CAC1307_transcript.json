Then one of two things happens: either your body \"burns\" these molecular components for their energy content through a process known as cellular respiration or these components are used as the building blocks for your body's own versions of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. The sum total of all these biochemical activities is what we call metabolism.",

      "role": "assistant",

The types of biomolecules produced by anabolism are the same as the types found in food—carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Exactly! And if the host ever becomes food, anabolic reactions in the subsequent host will result in different versions of the molecules. Thus, organisms in a food chain live off one another by absorbing one another's energy via catabolic reactions and then rearranging the remaining atoms and molecules via anabolic reactions into the biomolecules they need to survive.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes, it is remarkable! And these processes of catabolism and anabolism work together. In healthy muscle tissue, for example, the rate of muscle degradation (catabolism) is matched by the rate of muscle building (anabolism).",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's right! If you increase your food supply and exercise vigorously, it is possible to favor the muscle-building anabolic reactions over the muscle-destroying catabolic reactions. The result is an increase in muscle mass. Stop eating and exercising, however, and these anabolic reactions lose out to the catabolic reactions. The result is a decrease in muscle mass—you begin to waste away.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",

Many students recognize the term anabolic steroids from the sports news media, which are quick to report on famous athletes caught using these steroids for improved performance. Anabolism, therefore, is muscle-building, so catabolism must be muscle-degrading. A catabolic steroid would cause a loss of muscle mass, which is not generally desirable.",

For instance, there's a type of cattle called the Belgian Blue bull that has a natural genetic mutation affecting its anabolic processes.",

Without myostatin, the muscles of the bull become much more massive. Inhibitors of myostatin in humans may help offset the loss of muscle mass that occurs with conditions such as muscular dystrophy or as occurs in each of us as we age.",

Catabolism includes digestion and cellular respiration, which break down food to make ATP energy. Then anabolism uses that energy to build our own biomolecules like proteins and carbohydrates.
