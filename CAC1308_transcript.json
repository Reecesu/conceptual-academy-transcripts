Many students feel that way initially, but nutrition is a science that directly relates to our everyday lives, which makes it more approachable. Let's start by looking at what constitutes a healthy diet according to the USDA.\n\nThe USDA provides recommendations through what's called the food plate. According to this plate, an individual's daily diet should consist mostly of grains (such as bread, cereals, and pastas), fruits, and vegetables, with the amounts of dairy products and meats fairly limited and foods high in sugars or fats consumed only sparingly.\n\nTo better understand these recommendations, we can examine how the body handles the biomolecules contained in these foods.

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Great question! Let's start with carbohydrates, which predominate in most foods, especially those that form the base of the food plate.\n\nThere are two types of carbohydrates—nondigestible, called dietary fiber, and digestible, mainly starches and sugars. Dietary fiber helps keep things moving in the bowels, especially in the large intestine.\n\nFiber comes in two varieties: water-insoluble and water-soluble. Insoluble fiber consists mainly of cellulose, which is found in all food derived from plants. In general, the less processed the food, the higher the insoluble fiber content. Brown rice, for example, has a greater proportion of insoluble fiber than does white rice, which is made by milling away the rice seed's outer coating (along with numerous vitamins and minerals).",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Exactly right! Brown rice retains more of its nutritional value and fiber content.\n\nSoluble fiber is made of certain types of starches that are resistant to digestion in the small intestine. An example is pectin, which is added to jams and jellies because it acts as a thickening agent, becoming a gel when dissolved in a limited amount of water.\n\nSoluble fiber tends to lower cholesterol levels in the blood through its interactions with bile salts, which are cholesterol-derived substances produced in the liver and then secreted into the intestine. One of the functions of bile salts is to carry ingested lipids through the membranes of the intestine and into the bloodstream. The bile salts are then reabsorbed by the liver and cycled back to the intestine.\n\nSoluble fiber in the intestine binds to bile salts, which are then efficiently passed out of the body rather than reabsorbed. The liver responds by producing more bile salts, but to do so, it must utilize cholesterol, which it collects from the bloodstream. By this indirect route of binding with bile salts, soluble fiber tends to lower a person's cholesterol level. Foods rich in soluble fiber include fruits and certain grains, such as oats and barley.",

      "content": ": During digestion, the digestible carbohydrates—both starches and sugars—are transformed to glucose, which is absorbed into the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine. The body then utilizes this glucose to build energy molecules, such as ATP.\n\nCarbohydrate-containing foods are rated for how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. This rating is done with what is known as the glycemic index. The index compares how much a given food increases a person's blood glucose level relative to the increase seen when pure glucose is ingested, with the latter increase assigned a standard value of 100. In general, foods that are high in starch or sugar but low in dietary fiber are high on the glycemic index, a baked potato being a prime example.",

Thus, index values are merely ballpark figures. Given this qualification, however, the index provides valuable information for those people, such as individuals with diabetes, who need to pay close attention to their blood sugar levels.\n\nA number of problems are associated with eating carbohydrates with high glycemic indices. For example, the rapid spike in blood glucose levels causes the body to produce extra insulin, a blood-soluble protein that causes liver, muscle, and fat tissues to take up glucose from the blood. This lowers blood glucose levels. The body responds by releasing glucose-yielding glycogen, but also by triggering a sense of hunger, even if the person just ate. A meal rich in foods high on the glycemic index therefore promotes overeating, which usually leads to obesity.",

What really counts is the total number of Calories absorbed, not whether these Calories come from foods high or low on the index. For most people, however, ingesting foods low on the index makes maintaining a healthful caloric intake more manageable by controlling cravings.",

    {

      "content": ": Yes, there are! Another advantage of eating carbohydrates from foods that are low on the index is that these foods provide energy to the body over an extended period of time. For athletes, a diet rich in foods low on the glycemic index, such as spaghetti, translates to greater endurance.\n\nInterestingly, this greater endurance is just as useful for bodybuilders as it is for marathon runners. Having the energy required for building muscles is far more critical than having the supply of raw materials needed. Furthermore, the body's metabolism is versatile enough to generate proteins out of glucose. (For your information, it can even generate glucose out of proteins.) Thus, the bodybuilder's supply of proteins is ensured. A diet rich in carbohydrates is therefore more effective in allowing a bodybuilder to build muscles than is a diet rich in proteins.\n\nDespite the many advantages of eating carbohydrates low on the glycemic index, foods rich in carbohydrates high on the index, such as sucrose, are now more popular than ever. Many of these foods are highly processed and compose a narrow portion of the food pyramid. Although they are good for providing energy, the USDA recommends that they be consumed only sparingly, because they lack many of the essential nutrients.",

      "content": ": You're absolutely right, and I'm glad you're making these connections! Let's talk about fats.\n\nUnsaturated fats are generally more healthful than saturated fats for two key reasons. First, because your body uses saturated fats to synthesize cholesterol, eating more saturated fats allows you to synthesize more cholesterol. Unsaturated fats, by contrast, are not ideal starting materials for cholesterol synthesis.\n\nAnother reason unsaturated fats are more healthful relates to the way fats are associated with cholesterol. Fats and cholesterol are both lipids, which, on their own, are insoluble in blood. In order to move through the bloodstream, these compounds are packaged with bile salts, as we discussed earlier. Most lipids, however, are made water soluble by being packaged with water-soluble proteins in complexes called lipoproteins.\n\nLipoproteins are classified according to density. Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) serve primarily in the transport of fats throughout the body. Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) transport cholesterol to the cells, where it is used to build cell membranes. High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) bring cholesterol to the liver, where it is transformed into a variety of useful biomolecules.",

      "content": ": That's a common way people remember it, and you're on the right track! A diet high in saturated fats leads to elevated VLDL and LDL levels in the bloodstream. This is undesirable because these lipoproteins tend to form fatty deposits called plaque in the artery walls. Plaque deposits can become inflamed to the point where they rupture, releasing blood-clotting factors into the bloodstream. A blood clot formed around the rupture site is released into the bloodstream, where it can become lodged in a blood vessel and block the flow of blood to a particular region of the body. When that region is in the heart, the result is a heart attack. When that region is in the brain, the result is a stroke.\n\nIn contrast to saturated fats, unsaturated fats tend to increase blood HDL levels, which is desirable because these lipoproteins are effective at removing plaque from artery walls.",

      "content": ": You're asking great questions and making important connections! Triglycerides with unsaturated fatty acid components tend to be liquid at room temperature. They can be transformed to a more solid consistency, however, by hydrogenation, a chemical process in which hydrogen atoms are added to carbon–carbon double bonds.\n\nMix a partially hydrogenated vegetable oil with yellow food coloring, a little salt, and small amounts of the organic compound butyric acid for flavor and you have margarine, which became popular around the time of World War II as an alternative to butter. Many food products, such as chocolate bars, contain partially hydrogenated vegetable oils so that they are of a consistency that sells well in the marketplace.\n\nHydrogenation increases the percentage of saturated fats, however, and therefore makes these fats less healthful. Furthermore, some of the double bonds that remain are transformed to the trans- structural isomer. Because carbon chains containing trans-double bonds tend to be less kinked than chains containing cis- bonds, the partially hydrogenated fat has straighter chains. This means the fat is more likely to mimic the action of saturated fats in the body.",

Yes, let's talk about proteins.\n\nProteins are useful for their energy content, just as starches, sugars, and fats are, but perhaps the greatest importance of proteins lies in how our bodies use them for building such structures as enzymes, bones, muscles, and skin.\n\nOf the 20 amino acids the human body uses to build proteins, adults can produce, in sufficient amounts, 12 of them from carbohydrates and fatty acids. We must obtain the remaining eight from our food. These eight amino acids are called essential amino acids, in the sense that it is essential we get adequate amounts of them from our food. To support rapid growth, infants and children require, in addition to the eight amino acids listed for adults, large amounts of arginine and histidine, which they can obtain only from their diets. Therefore, for infants and juveniles, there is a total of ten essential amino acids. (The term essential is unfortunate, because in truth, all 20 amino acids are vital to our good health.)",

Why our bodies produce ample amounts of some amino acids and not others can be explained by looking at the chemical structures of the amino acid side groups. The nonessential amino acids have side groups that tend to be simple and therefore can be produced by the body without much effort. The essential amino acids, however, tend to be biochemically more difficult to create.\n\nThe body, therefore, can save energy by obtaining these amino acids from outside sources. Over the course of evolution, our capacity to synthesize these amino acids diminished. Similarly, we have lost the capacity to synthesize vitamins, which are also complex molecules more efficiently obtained from dietary sources. In other words, we let other living organisms go through the metabolic expense of synthesizing these biomolecules and then we eat those organisms.",

A vegetarian diet provides adequate protein only if it includes a variety of protein sources so that a deficiency in one source is compensated for by an abundance in another source.\n\nSufficient protein can generally be obtained in a vegetarian diet by combining a legume, such as peas or beans, with a grain, such as wheat or corn.
