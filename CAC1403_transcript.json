Chemotherapy refers to the use of drugs that destroy disease-causing agents without doing excessive harm to the host. This approach works by taking advantage of the ways a disease-causing agent is different from the host, and it's effective in treating many diseases, including bacterial and viral infections, as well as cancer.",

Stress to the nervous system, such as emotional stress or sunburn, can cause the virus to replicate, leading to an outbreak through the skin. When they're not replicating, these viruses remain in nerve cells, where they aren't detected by the body's immune system, which has little activity in nerve cells.
