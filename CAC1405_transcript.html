What's interesting about amphetamines is their chemical structure - they're structurally similar to neurotransmitters in your brain called norepinephrine and dopamine. Because of this similarity, amphetamines can bind to receptor sites for these neurotransmitters and mimic their effects on stress neurons, including triggering the fight-or-flight response and creating a sense of euphoria.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-8"><p>That's part of it, yes. The stimulating and mood-altering effects of amphetamines give them a high abuse potential. They can cause side effects including insomnia, irritability, loss of appetite, and paranoia. Amphetamines are particularly hard on the heart. When heart muscles become hyperactive, they can tear. Subsequent scarring of tissue ultimately leads to a weaker heart. Additionally, amphetamines cause blood vessels to constrict and blood pressure to rise, increasing the likelihood of heart attack or stroke, especially for those who already have high blood pressure.</p></div>

In 1900, about 2 to 5 percent of the U.S. population was addicted to morphine and cocaine, which were the prime and usually secret ingredients of unregulated potions advertised to alleviate practically any illness. This drug addiction was reduced dramatically after the passage of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, which created the Food and Drug Administration, required prescriptions for certain drugs, and mandated that habit-forming medicines be labeled as such.</p><br><p>But let's talk about how amphetamines and cocaine actually work in the brain.

The body recognizes the excessive stimulatory actions produced by these drugs and tries to compensate. To deal with the overstimulation, the body creates more depressant receptor sites for neurotransmitters that inhibit nerve transmission. A tolerance for the drugs therefore develops.</p><br><p>To receive the same stimulatory effect, the abuser is forced to increase the dose. And this induces the body to create even more depressant receptor sites. The end result over the long term is that the abuser's natural levels of dopamine and norepinephrine are insufficient to make up for the excessive number of depressant sites. Lasting personality changes are thus often observed. Addicts, even when recovered, often report feelings of psychological depression.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-30"><p>Yes, nicotine is another legal, but far more toxic, stimulant. As we mentioned earlier, tobacco plants produce nicotine as a chemical defense against insects. This compound is so potent that a single dose of only about 60 milligrams is lethal. A single cigarette may contain up to 5 milligrams of nicotine. Most of this is destroyed by the heat of the burning embers, so less than 1 milligram is typically inhaled by the smoker.</p><br><p>Nicotine and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which acts on maintenance neurons, have similar structures. Nicotine molecules are therefore able to bind to acetylcholine receptor sites and trigger many of acetylcholine's effects, including relaxation and increased digestion. This explains the tendency of smokers to smoke after eating meals.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-32"><p>Exactly. In addition, acetylcholine is used for muscle contraction, so the smoker may also experience some muscle stimulation immediately after smoking. After these initial responses, however, nicotine molecules remain bound to the acetylcholine receptor sites. This blocks acetylcholine molecules from binding, and the result is that the activity of these neurons is depressed.</p><br><p>Recall that both maintenance neurons and stress neurons are always working. Thus, inhibiting the activity of one type makes the other type more effective. So, as nicotine depresses the maintenance neurons, it favors the stress neurons. This raises the smoker's blood pressure and stresses the heart.</p></div>

In the brain, nicotine affects the stress system directly by enhancing the release of stress neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine. Nicotine also increases the levels of dopamine in the reward center. Furthermore, when inhaled, nicotine is a fast-acting drug. All of these factors give nicotine a high level of addictiveness.</p><br><p>Animal studies show inhaled nicotine to be about six times as addictive as injected heroin. Because nicotine leaves the body quickly, withdrawal symptoms begin about 1 hour after a cigarette is smoked, which means the smoker is inclined to light up frequently.</p></div>

Initially, interest was focused on mescaline, the hallucinogenic component of several species of cacti used in religious ceremonies by some Native American tribes in the western United States.</p><br><p>One plant yielding this compound is the peyote cactus. Synthetic derivatives, such as methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), also became popular.</p><br><p>Unlike LSD, these hallucinogens do not exert their effects by binding to serotonin receptor sites. Rather, they stimulate the release of excess quantities of serotonin. This pathway is not as effective as LSD's direct approach, and as a result, these drugs are 1/200 to 1/4000 as potent as LSD.</p><br><p>Because larger doses of mescaline and MDA are required, a multitude of other effects are seen, such as a marked stimulation of the stress neurons. In addition, regular use of these compounds causes withdrawal symptoms.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-48"><p>Yes, most notably, cannabinoids accumulate in the area of the brain where short-term memories are sorted. Every experience we ever have goes through this center. Some things—the image of a sidewalk crack you saw on a morning walk, say—get thrown out. Other experiences, such as your first date, get filed away in long-term memory storage.</p><br><p>Cannabinoids disrupt this filing system so that memories are not sorted appropriately. In addition, people under the influence of cannabinoids may have a distorted sense of time and unclear thoughts.</p><br><p>Another effect of cannabinoids is unrestful sleep. The brain sorts through memories during a phase of sleep marked by rapid eye movement (REM). People who smoke marijuana lose REM sleep time, which results in irritability the following day. Once the memory filing center is cleared of the drug, which may take days or even weeks, the brain makes up for lost time by having extra-long periods of REM.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-52"><p>Depressants are a class of drugs that inhibit the ability of neurons to conduct impulses. Two commonly used depressants are ethanol and benzodiazepines.</p><br><p>Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol or simply alcohol, is by far the most widely used depressant. In the United States, about a third of the population, or about 100 million people, drink alcohol. It is well established that alcohol consumption leads to about 150,000 deaths each year in the United States. The causes of these deaths are overdoses of alcohol alone, overdoses of alcohol combined with other depressants, alcohol-induced violent crime, cirrhosis of the liver, and alcohol-related traffic accidents.</p></div>

Alcohol is not a stimulant, however. From the first sip to the last, body systems are being depressed.</p><br><p>Let's also talk about benzodiazepines. These are a potent class of antianxiety agents. Compared to many other types of depressants, benzodiazepines are relatively safe and rarely produce cardiovascular and respiratory depression.</p><br><p>Their antianxiety effects were identified by chance in 1957. During a routine laboratory cleanup, a synthesized compound that had been sitting on the shelf for two years was submitted for routine testing despite the fact that compounds thought to have similar structures had shown no promising pharmacologic activity.</p><br><p>This particular compound, now known as chlordiazepoxide, contained an unexpected seven-membered ring. Chlordiazepoxide showed a significant calming effect in humans and by 1960 was marketed as an anti-anxiety agent under the trade name Librium®. Shortly thereafter, a derivative, diazepam, was found to be five to ten times more potent than Librium. In 1963, diazepam hit the market under the trade name Valium®.</p></div>

At small concentrations, few chloride ions are permitted into the neuron; these low concentrations of ions decrease inhibitions, alter judgment, and impair muscle control. As the person continues to drink and the chloride ion concentration inside the neuron rises, both reflexes and consciousness diminish, eventually to the point of coma and then death.</p><br><p>Recall from our discussion of cocaine and amphetamines that the body responds to the long-term abuse of these stimulants by creating more depressant receptor sites. Likewise, the body recognizes the excessive inhibitory actions produced by alcohol and tries to recover by increasing the number of synaptic receptor sites that lead to nerve excitation.</p><br><p>In this way, an individual can develop a tolerance for alcohol. To receive the same inhibitory effect, the drinker is forced to drink more, which induces the body to create even more excitable synaptic receptor sites. Eventually, an excess of these excitatory receptor sites leads to perpetual body tremors, which can be subdued either by more drinking or, with greater difficulty, by a long-term cessation of alcohol consumption.</p></div>

I'm Alia, and I'm here to support the learning of core science concepts. Let's get started. How can I help you today?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Hi Alia. I need to learn about psychoactive drugs for my science class. I've always been pretty nervous about science topics - I avoided them in high school whenever I could. But I need to understand this for my general education requirement.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": I'm glad you're tackling this topic! Many students find that science becomes more interesting when it connects to real-world topics like this one. Let's start with psychoactive drugs. These are any drugs that affect the mind or behavior. In this discussion, we'll focus on two main classes of psychoactive drugs: stimulants and depressants.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Okay, so stimulants and depressants. I think I have a basic idea of what those are - like coffee is a stimulant, right? It keeps you awake?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's right! Stimulants activate what we call the \"stress neurons\" in your brain. They enhance the intensity of our reactions to stimuli, causing brief periods of heightened awareness, quick thinking, and elevated mood. Common stimulants include amphetamines, cocaine, caffeine (as you mentioned), and nicotine.\n\nLet's start with amphetamines. These are a family of stimulants that include the parent compound amphetamine, also known as \"speed,\" and derivatives like methamphetamine and pseudoephedrine.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wait, isn't pseudoephedrine in cold medicine? That's a stimulant?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, pseudoephedrine is used in some cold medicines. What's interesting about amphetamines is their chemical structure - they're structurally similar to neurotransmitters in your brain called norepinephrine and dopamine. Because of this similarity, amphetamines can bind to receptor sites for these neurotransmitters and mimic their effects on stress neurons, including triggering the fight-or-flight response and creating a sense of euphoria.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So they basically trick the brain by looking like natural chemicals? That's why they're addictive?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's part of it, yes. The stimulating and mood-altering effects of amphetamines give them a high abuse potential. They can cause side effects including insomnia, irritability, loss of appetite, and paranoia. Amphetamines are particularly hard on the heart. When heart muscles become hyperactive, they can tear. Subsequent scarring of tissue ultimately leads to a weaker heart. Additionally, amphetamines cause blood vessels to constrict and blood pressure to rise, increasing the likelihood of heart attack or stroke, especially for those who already have high blood pressure.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That sounds pretty scary. What about cocaine? I know it's illegal, but I'm not sure exactly why it's so dangerous.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Cocaine is another well-known stimulant, but it's natural - isolated from the South American coca plant. Once in the bloodstream, cocaine produces a sense of euphoria and increased stamina. It's also a powerful local anesthetic when applied topically.\n\nInterestingly, within a few decades of its first isolation from plant material in 1860, cocaine was used as a local anesthetic for eye surgery and dentistry. This practice was stopped once safer local anesthetics were discovered in the early 1900s.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I had no idea cocaine was used for medical purposes! So people just used to go to the doctor and get cocaine?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, and there's an interesting historical note here. In 1900, about 2 to 5 percent of the U.S. population was addicted to morphine and cocaine, which were the prime and usually secret ingredients of unregulated potions advertised to alleviate practically any illness. This drug addiction was reduced dramatically after the passage of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, which created the Food and Drug Administration, required prescriptions for certain drugs, and mandated that habit-forming medicines be labeled as such.\n\nBut let's talk about how amphetamines and cocaine actually work in the brain. Both affect a process called neurotransmitter reuptake.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": What's reuptake? I've never heard that term before.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Reuptake is the body's way of recycling neurotransmitters, which are molecules that are difficult to synthesize. Special proteins embedded in the membrane of neurons pull once-used neurotransmitter molecules back into the presynaptic neuron so they can be reused.\n\nAmphetamines open these reuptake channels so that neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine and dopamine, pass freely in and out of the synapse. This increases their concentration in the synapse, which provides a feeling of being \"high.\"\n\nCocaine acts a bit differently. It binds specifically to the dopamine reuptake protein, blocking the reuptake of this neurotransmitter. As a result, dopamine accumulates in the synapse, leading to feelings of euphoria.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So basically they both mess with the brain's normal recycling system for neurotransmitters? That makes sense. I'm guessing that's why people crash after using these drugs - the brain runs out of these chemicals?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's exactly right. Amphetamines and cocaine share a similar profile of addictiveness. The degree of addictiveness is greatly dependent upon how the drug is taken. In general, the quicker the drug is absorbed by the body, the greater the level of addictiveness.\n\nImportantly, this relationship is not linear. A drug absorbed twice as fast may end up being not twice as addictive, but ten times as addictive. This happens because when the drug is absorbed quickly, its concentration is much greater, leading to greater intensity of effects.\n\nInjecting a drug into a vein is the fastest route of administration, followed by inhaling the vapors of what's called the \"free-base\" form of the drug.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wait, what's \"free-base\"? I've heard that term before but never really understood it.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a good question. Free-base means the nitrogen in the molecule is \"free\" of a hydrogen ion, which makes the molecule nonpolar and volatile when heated. The street drug crystal meth, also known as ice, is the free-base form of methamphetamine. Similarly, crack is the free-base form of cocaine. These forms are extremely dangerous drugs of abuse.\n\nThe intense high is routinely followed by an intense low, which results as the supply of neurotransmitters becomes exhausted. Of course, the low prompts the user to seek more of the drug.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I think I understand the pattern now. So with cocaine specifically, what happens in the brain when someone takes it and then when it wears off?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": The euphoric state induced by cocaine is only temporary because enzymes in the synaptic cleft metabolize and deactivate the dopamine. Once cocaine is metabolized by enzymes, dopamine reuptake is again permitted. By this time, however, there is very little dopamine in the cleft to be reabsorbed.\n\nNor is there an adequate supply of dopamine in the presynaptic neuron, which is unable to make sufficient quantities of dopamine without the recycling process. The net result is a depletion of dopamine that causes severe depression.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's why addiction is so powerful - people feel terrible without the drug. Does the body eventually adjust to these drugs?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, but not in a beneficial way. Long-term amphetamine or cocaine abuse leads to a deterioration of the nervous system. The body recognizes the excessive stimulatory actions produced by these drugs and tries to compensate. To deal with the overstimulation, the body creates more depressant receptor sites for neurotransmitters that inhibit nerve transmission. A tolerance for the drugs therefore develops.\n\nTo receive the same stimulatory effect, the abuser is forced to increase the dose. And this induces the body to create even more depressant receptor sites. The end result over the long term is that the abuser's natural levels of dopamine and norepinephrine are insufficient to make up for the excessive number of depressant sites. Lasting personality changes are thus often observed. Addicts, even when recovered, often report feelings of psychological depression.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So addiction involves both physical and mental components?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Exactly. Drug addiction is not completely understood, but scientists do know that it involves both physical and psychological dependence. Physical dependence is the need to continue taking the drug to avoid withdrawal symptoms. For amphetamines, drug withdrawal symptoms include depression, fatigue, and a strong desire to eat.\n\nPsychological dependence is the craving to continue drug use. This craving may be the most serious and deep-rooted aspect of addiction. It can persist even after withdrawal from physical dependence, frequently leading to renewed drug-seeking behavior.\n\nTo recover, it's imperative that the addict be removed from all cues that bring the experience of drug use to mind. This, however, is not usually possible as it may involve moving to a completely new social environment.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That makes a lot of sense. Let's talk about something more everyday - what about caffeine? I drink coffee pretty much every day. Is that bad?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Caffeine is a much milder and legal stimulant. It facilitates the release of norepinephrine into synaptic clefts. Caffeine also exerts many other effects on the body, such as the dilation of arteries, relaxation of bronchial and gastrointestinal muscles, and stimulation of stomach acid secretion.\n\nThe caffeine people ingest comes from various natural sources, including coffee beans, teas, kola nuts, and cocoa beans. Kola nut extracts are used for making cola drinks, and cocoa beans (not to be confused with the cocaine-producing coca plant) are roasted and then ground into a paste used for making chocolate.\n\nCaffeine is relatively easy to remove from these natural products using high-pressure carbon dioxide, which selectively dissolves the caffeine. This allows the production of \"decaffeinated\" beverages, many of which, however, still contain small amounts of caffeine.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I didn't know that kola nuts were used in cola drinks. So do soda companies add caffeine separately now?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, that's right. Interestingly, cola drink manufacturers use decaffeinated kola nut extract in their beverages. The caffeine is added in a separate step to guarantee a particular caffeine concentration. In the United States, about 2 million pounds of caffeine is added to soft drinks each year.\n\nFor comparison, the maximum daily dose of caffeine tolerable by most adults is about 1500 milligrams, but most caffeinated products contain much less than that per serving.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": What about nicotine? I know it's addictive, but is it actually a stimulant?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, nicotine is another legal, but far more toxic, stimulant. As we mentioned earlier, tobacco plants produce nicotine as a chemical defense against insects. This compound is so potent that a single dose of only about 60 milligrams is lethal. A single cigarette may contain up to 5 milligrams of nicotine. Most of this is destroyed by the heat of the burning embers, so less than 1 milligram is typically inhaled by the smoker.\n\nNicotine and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which acts on maintenance neurons, have similar structures. Nicotine molecules are therefore able to bind to acetylcholine receptor sites and trigger many of acetylcholine's effects, including relaxation and increased digestion. This explains the tendency of smokers to smoke after eating meals.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Oh! So that's why people often smoke after dinner. I never knew there was a scientific reason for that.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Exactly. In addition, acetylcholine is used for muscle contraction, so the smoker may also experience some muscle stimulation immediately after smoking. After these initial responses, however, nicotine molecules remain bound to the acetylcholine receptor sites. This blocks acetylcholine molecules from binding, and the result is that the activity of these neurons is depressed.\n\nRecall that both maintenance neurons and stress neurons are always working. Thus, inhibiting the activity of one type makes the other type more effective. So, as nicotine depresses the maintenance neurons, it favors the stress neurons. This raises the smoker's blood pressure and stresses the heart.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So nicotine is actually doing multiple things at once? That sounds complicated.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": It is complex. In the brain, nicotine affects the stress system directly by enhancing the release of stress neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine. Nicotine also increases the levels of dopamine in the reward center. Furthermore, when inhaled, nicotine is a fast-acting drug. All of these factors give nicotine a high level of addictiveness.\n\nAnimal studies show inhaled nicotine to be about six times as addictive as injected heroin. Because nicotine leaves the body quickly, withdrawal symptoms begin about 1 hour after a cigarette is smoked, which means the smoker is inclined to light up frequently.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's scary! I had no idea nicotine was that addictive. And what are the long-term effects of smoking?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": The long-term effects are quite severe. In the United States, about 480,000 individuals die each year from tobacco-related health problems such as emphysema, heart disease, and various forms of cancer, especially lung cancer, which is brought on primarily by tobacco's tar component.\n\nSome relief from the addiction can be obtained with nicotine chewing gum and nicotine skin patches. In order for any method to be effective, however, the smoker must first genuinely want to quit smoking.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So caffeine and nicotine are both stimulants, but they work differently, right? I'm trying to keep it all straight.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a good question for clarification. Caffeine and nicotine both add stress to the nervous system, but they do so by different means. Caffeine stimulates the release of the stress neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Nicotine enhances the release of norepinephrine too, but it also depresses the action of the maintenance neurotransmitter acetylcholine.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Got it. Let's move on to a different type of drug. What about drugs that make people see things that aren't there?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Those would be hallucinogens, also known as psychedelics. A hallucinogen is any drug that can alter visual perceptions and skew the user's sense of time. Hallucinogens have a pronounced effect on moods, thought patterns, and behavior.\n\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and mescaline represent two main categories of hallucinogens. Cannabinoids, the psychoactive component of marijuana, are in a closely related category of drugs. Cannabinoids do not alter visual perceptions and therefore are not true hallucinogens. They are similar to hallucinogens in other regards, however, such as in their ability to alter a person's sense of time.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I didn't know marijuana wasn't considered a true hallucinogen. How does LSD work? I've heard it can be really dangerous.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": LSD is the prototypic hallucinogen. Its molecular structure is very similar to that of serotonin, and this similarity permits LSD to activate serotonin receptors even more effectively than serotonin itself.\n\nIt's LSD's ability to interfere with serotonin's work that causes LSD users to experience an altered sense of reality. Because LSD also stimulates the reward center, the change in sensory organization is usually, but not always, characterized as a favorable experience.\n\nLSD also triggers the stress neurons, resulting in enlarged pupils, elevated blood pressure and heart rate, nausea, and tremors. These stress effects can shift the mood of an affected person to panic and anxiety.\n\nBecause the LSD molecule is nonpolar, quantities may be trapped and hidden away in nonpolar fatty tissue, only to be released months later and result in a mild recurrence of the experience known as a flashback.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Flashbacks sound terrifying. What about mescaline? Isn't that from some kind of cactus?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, in the early 1970s, there was a significant rise in the street use of hallucinogenic derivatives of the compound phenylethylamine. Initially, interest was focused on mescaline, the hallucinogenic component of several species of cacti used in religious ceremonies by some Native American tribes in the western United States.\n\nOne plant yielding this compound is the peyote cactus. Synthetic derivatives, such as methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), also became popular.\n\nUnlike LSD, these hallucinogens do not exert their effects by binding to serotonin receptor sites. Rather, they stimulate the release of excess quantities of serotonin. This pathway is not as effective as LSD's direct approach, and as a result, these drugs are 1/200 to 1/4000 as potent as LSD.\n\nBecause larger doses of mescaline and MDA are required, a multitude of other effects are seen, such as a marked stimulation of the stress neurons. In addition, regular use of these compounds causes withdrawal symptoms.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": What about marijuana? I know it's legal in some states now, even recreationally. How does it work in the brain?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Cannabinoids are the psychoactive components of marijuana, which has the species name Cannabis sativa. Concentrations of cannabinoids vary greatly from plant to plant. The original strains of this plant species contain very little of these psychoactive components and have been used for many centuries for their great fiber qualities.\n\nOn average, strains of Cannabis that may be smoked for psychoactive effects contain about 4 percent cannabinoid derivatives. The most active of these derivatives is the compound \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).\n\nWe do not completely understand how THC exerts its psychoactive effect. In 1990, a specific receptor site for the THC molecule was discovered. A few years later, a peptide occurring naturally in the body was found to bind to this receptor and initiate marijuana-like responses. These results suggest that THC functions by mimicking this naturally occurring peptide.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So our bodies actually have cannabinoid receptors naturally? That's weird. What does marijuana do to memory? I've heard it affects that.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, most notably, cannabinoids accumulate in the area of the brain where short-term memories are sorted. Every experience we ever have goes through this center. Some things\u2014the image of a sidewalk crack you saw on a morning walk, say\u2014get thrown out. Other experiences, such as your first date, get filed away in long-term memory storage.\n\nCannabinoids disrupt this filing system so that memories are not sorted appropriately. In addition, people under the influence of cannabinoids may have a distorted sense of time and unclear thoughts.\n\nAnother effect of cannabinoids is unrestful sleep. The brain sorts through memories during a phase of sleep marked by rapid eye movement (REM). People who smoke marijuana lose REM sleep time, which results in irritability the following day. Once the memory filing center is cleared of the drug, which may take days or even weeks, the brain makes up for lost time by having extra-long periods of REM.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Are there any medical uses for marijuana? I've heard it helps with certain conditions.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, cannabinoids are known to have a number of medicinal uses. For example, they reduce the symptoms of glaucoma, a disease in which there is a dangerous buildup of pressure within the eyes. They also help to stimulate a person's appetite, which is important for people undergoing cancer chemotherapy and for those suffering from diseases such as AIDS. For these purposes, many states allow marijuana to be prescribed by a physician.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Thanks for clarifying why marijuana isn't considered a true hallucinogen - it doesn't really cause visual hallucinations. Let's move on to depressants. What are those exactly?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Depressants are a class of drugs that inhibit the ability of neurons to conduct impulses. Two commonly used depressants are ethanol and benzodiazepines.\n\nEthanol, also known as ethyl alcohol or simply alcohol, is by far the most widely used depressant. In the United States, about a third of the population, or about 100 million people, drink alcohol. It is well established that alcohol consumption leads to about 150,000 deaths each year in the United States. The causes of these deaths are overdoses of alcohol alone, overdoses of alcohol combined with other depressants, alcohol-induced violent crime, cirrhosis of the liver, and alcohol-related traffic accidents.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I thought alcohol was a stimulant because it seems to make people more active and talkative at parties. Is that not right?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a common misconception. One of the initial effects of alcohol is a depression of social inhibitions, which can serve to bolster mood. Alcohol is not a stimulant, however. From the first sip to the last, body systems are being depressed.\n\nLet's also talk about benzodiazepines. These are a potent class of antianxiety agents. Compared to many other types of depressants, benzodiazepines are relatively safe and rarely produce cardiovascular and respiratory depression.\n\nTheir antianxiety effects were identified by chance in 1957. During a routine laboratory cleanup, a synthesized compound that had been sitting on the shelf for two years was submitted for routine testing despite the fact that compounds thought to have similar structures had shown no promising pharmacologic activity.\n\nThis particular compound, now known as chlordiazepoxide, contained an unexpected seven-membered ring. Chlordiazepoxide showed a significant calming effect in humans and by 1960 was marketed as an anti-anxiety agent under the trade name Librium\u00ae. Shortly thereafter, a derivative, diazepam, was found to be five to ten times more potent than Librium. In 1963, diazepam hit the market under the trade name Valium\u00ae.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So how do alcohol and these benzodiazepines actually affect the brain? Do they work the same way?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Alcohol and benzodiazepines exert their depressant effect primarily by enhancing the action of a neurotransmitter called GABA. GABA keeps electric impulses from passing through a neuron by binding to a receptor site on a channel that penetrates the cell membrane of the neuron.\n\nWhen GABA binds to the receptor site, the channel opens, allowing chloride ions to migrate into the neuron. The resulting negative charge buildup in the neuron maintains the negative electric potential across the cell membrane. This inhibits a reversal to a positive potential and prevents an impulse from traveling along the neuron.\n\nEthanol mimics the effect of GABA by binding to GABA receptor sites. This allows chloride ions to enter the neuron. The effect of alcohol is dose-dependent, which means the greater the amount consumed, the greater the effect.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So if I understand correctly, alcohol basically enhances the inhibitory signals in the brain? That's why it slows everything down?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's exactly right. At small concentrations, few chloride ions are permitted into the neuron; these low concentrations of ions decrease inhibitions, alter judgment, and impair muscle control. As the person continues to drink and the chloride ion concentration inside the neuron rises, both reflexes and consciousness diminish, eventually to the point of coma and then death.\n\nRecall from our discussion of cocaine and amphetamines that the body responds to the long-term abuse of these stimulants by creating more depressant receptor sites. Likewise, the body recognizes the excessive inhibitory actions produced by alcohol and tries to recover by increasing the number of synaptic receptor sites that lead to nerve excitation.\n\nIn this way, an individual can develop a tolerance for alcohol. To receive the same inhibitory effect, the drinker is forced to drink more, which induces the body to create even more excitable synaptic receptor sites. Eventually, an excess of these excitatory receptor sites leads to perpetual body tremors, which can be subdued either by more drinking or, with greater difficulty, by a long-term cessation of alcohol consumption.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": And what about benzodiazepines? Do they work the same way as alcohol?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Benzodiazepines exert their depressant effects by binding to receptor sites located adjacent to GABA receptor sites. Benzodiazepine binding merely helps GABA bind. Because benzodiazepine doesn't directly open chloride-ion channels, overdoses of this compound are less hazardous than those of many alternative depressants, making the benzodiazepines the drugs of choice for treating symptoms of anxiety.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So let me see if I understand - when chloride ions enter a neuron, does that increase or decrease the neuron's activity?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Chloride ions inside the neuron help to maintain the negative electric potential. This inhibits the neuron from being able to conduct an impulse. Chloride ions, therefore, decrease the activity of a neuron.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Thanks Alia, this was really helpful.
