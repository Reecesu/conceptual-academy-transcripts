A drug absorbed twice as fast may end up being not twice as addictive, but ten times as addictive. This happens because when the drug is absorbed quickly, its concentration is much greater, leading to greater intensity of effects.\n\nInjecting a drug into a vein is the fastest route of administration, followed by inhaling the vapors of what's called the \"free-base\" form of the drug.",

A tolerance for the drugs therefore develops.\n\nTo receive the same stimulatory effect, the abuser is forced to increase the dose. And this induces the body to create even more depressant receptor sites. The end result over the long term is that the abuser's natural levels of dopamine and norepinephrine are insufficient to make up for the excessive number of depressant sites.

This craving may be the most serious and deep-rooted aspect of addiction. It can persist even after withdrawal from physical dependence, frequently leading to renewed drug-seeking behavior.\n\nTo recover, it's imperative that the addict be removed from all cues that bring the experience of drug use to mind.

Most of this is destroyed by the heat of the burning embers, so less than 1 milligram is typically inhaled by the smoker.\n\nNicotine and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which acts on maintenance neurons, have similar structures.

      "content": ": Alcohol and benzodiazepines exert their depressant effect primarily by enhancing the action of a neurotransmitter called GABA. GABA keeps electric impulses from passing through a neuron by binding to a receptor site on a channel that penetrates the cell membrane of the neuron.\n\nWhen GABA binds to the receptor site, the channel opens, allowing chloride ions to migrate into the neuron. The resulting negative charge buildup in the neuron maintains the negative electric potential across the cell membrane. This inhibits a reversal to a positive potential and prevents an impulse from traveling along the neuron.\n\nEthanol mimics the effect of GABA by binding to GABA receptor sites. This allows chloride ions to enter the neuron. The effect of alcohol is dose-dependent, which means the greater the amount consumed, the greater the effect.",

      "content": ": That's exactly right. At small concentrations, few chloride ions are permitted into the neuron; these low concentrations of ions decrease inhibitions, alter judgment, and impair muscle control. As the person continues to drink and the chloride ion concentration inside the neuron rises, both reflexes and consciousness diminish, eventually to the point of coma and then death.\n\nRecall from our discussion of cocaine and amphetamines that the body responds to the long-term abuse of these stimulants by creating more depressant receptor sites. Likewise, the body recognizes the excessive inhibitory actions produced by alcohol and tries to recover by increasing the number of synaptic receptor sites that lead to nerve excitation.\n\nIn this way, an individual can develop a tolerance for alcohol. To receive the same inhibitory effect, the drinker is forced to drink more, which induces the body to create even more excitable synaptic receptor sites. Eventually, an excess of these excitatory receptor sites leads to perpetual body tremors, which can be subdued either by more drinking or, with greater difficulty, by a long-term cessation of alcohol consumption.",
