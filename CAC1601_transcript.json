As the atmosphere becomes saturated with moisture, the water precipitates in the form of either rain or snow. This constant water movement and phase changing is called the hydrologic cycle.",

Instead of forming clouds over the water, however, the moist air is blown by winds until it is over land. Now there are four possibilities for what happens to the water once it precipitates.",

Although the reservoir of groundwater is great, when the pumping rate exceeds the recharge rate, there can be a problem.\n\nIn wet climates, such as in the Pacific Northwest, extraction is often balanced by recharge. In dry climates, however, extraction can easily exceed recharge. To support large populations, these areas must import their water from distant sources, typically through aqueducts. In southern California, for example, most of the fresh water comes from the Colorado River through aqueducts that stretch hundreds of miles.",
