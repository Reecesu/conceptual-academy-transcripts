Today we'll explore water consumption in the United States, which is an important environmental topic that affects our daily lives. Let's start with how water usage is tracked. The U.S. Geological Survey, or USGS, began compiling national water use data in 1950. Since then, this federal agency has been conducting surveys at 5-year intervals. Would you like to know what these surveys reveal about how we use water?",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's a thoughtful observation. The five-year interval allows the USGS to collect comprehensive data across the entire country, which takes significant time and resources. Also, water usage patterns typically don't change dramatically from year to year, so this timeframe provides meaningful trends. According to their findings, the bulk of water in the United States is used for irrigation and as a coolant in the generation of thermoelectric power.",

      "content": ": Thermoelectric power refers to electricity generated by heat, typically in power plants that use fossil fuels, nuclear energy, or geothermal energy. These plants use large amounts of water for cooling. Let me share some specific data with you. According to the 2015 USGS survey, water usage in the United States totaled about 1219 billions of liters per day.",

Based on the 2015 data and a population of 321 million, the per-person water usage in the United States was 3,798 liters per day. However, according to the USGS, each person's direct personal use was only about 8 percent of that amount, which comes to about 304 liters per day.",

The other three-fourths—about 228 liters—becomes household wastewater from our bathtubs, toilets, sinks, and washing machines.

Since we as a population consume only about 1219 billion liters per day of the fresh water available to us (about 18%), it might seem like there's little need to conserve.",

      "content": ": That's a natural conclusion to draw, but there's an important distinction to make. This percentage is an average across the whole country. In many drier regions of the western United States, water usage already exceeds the rate at which aquifers in the region are recharged. In Albuquerque, New Mexico, for example, escalating water consumption has caused the underlying aquifer to drop by about 50 meters over the past 40 years. Beneath the Great Plains, the massive Ogallala Aquifer is also disappearing.",

Deep water deposits, for example, are often high in dissolved solids.

By 2015, however, the withdrawal rate had declined to 1219 billion liters per day (319 billion gallons/day) even though the population grew from 230 million to 321 million over the same time period.",

A well is dug at the indicated location, groundwater is revealed, and the dowser is paid for their services. Of course, the dowser is usually successful because groundwater is nearly everywhere.
