Fish start to die when the concentration of dissolved oxygen dips below 3 milligrams/liter. Once the sewage is consumed, the dissolved oxygen level begins to rise.",

Conventional secondary wastewater plants use electric energy to blow air into the wastewater. This aeration consumes 60 percent or more of the total electric energy used in wastewater treatment.\n\nThere are also more sustainable approaches. In an advanced integrated pond (AIP) system, good for communities of fewer than 10,000 people, algae and other plants use solar energy and photosynthesis to saturate the wastewater directly with oxygen. AIP systems are particularly applicable in Sun Belt communities, where solar energy is plentiful, and in developing nations, where the supply of electric energy is minimal or nonexistent.",
