The primary reason we get so much energy from the Sun is its enormous size.\n\nIf you were to look at the Earth next to the Sun, our planet would appear as just a tiny dot. In fact, the Earth is so small by comparison that if we represented it on a photo of the Sun, it would be just a small blue dot.

However, many energy sources we use daily are indirectly solar-powered.\n\nFor instance, when we burn plant material, we're actually releasing solar energy that was captured through photosynthesis. Similarly, when we burn fossil fuels, we're using the decayed remains of ancient photosynthetic plants, which also captured solar energy. Even hydroelectric dams, windmills, and photovoltaic cells are all driven by solar radiation.\n\nEnergy is abundant all around us. The challenge is figuring out how to best capture and utilize it. Let's start by looking at how energy is delivered to us through electricity.",

All usable energy, regardless of its source, is delivered to us in one of two forms: fuel or electricity.\n\nWhat makes electricity so special is the ease with which it can be used to transmit energy across distances and to many locations simultaneously. This property makes electricity one of our most convenient forms of energy. However, producing electricity requires the input of some other source of energy, such as burning fuel.",

This motion causes electrons in the wire to slosh back and forth. Because the electrons are moving, they possess kinetic energy and therefore have the capacity to do work.",

Here's a helpful analogy: if energy is money, then power is the rate at which that money is spent.\n\nElectric power is measured in watts, where 1 watt equals 1 joule per second:\n1 watt = 1 joule/1 second\n\nA lot of watts means that a lot of energy is being consumed quickly. For example, a 100-watt lightbulb consumes 100 joules of energy each second, while a 40-watt bulb consumes only 40 joules each second. The lower the wattage of the bulb, the less energy you're consuming per second.",

For a small city of 100,000 households, this adds up to a rate of 80 million watts, or 80 megawatts (MW).\n\nHowever, this is just the average rate of energy consumption. To meet peak demands, electric power plants must sometimes quadruple their average output. This is why small cities that average 80 MW require electric power plants that can produce energy at a power rating of 300 megawatts or higher.",

    {

      "content": ": Yes, these needs are easily met by present-day power plants. A typical coal-fired plant produces around 500 megawatts of electrical energy, a large nuclear plant can produce about 1500 megawatts, and a large hydroelectric dam can produce more than 10,000 megawatts.\n\nOne factor affecting the cost of electricity is the source of the energy. Fossil fuels and nuclear fuels produce hundreds of megawatts of power from a single power plant and can serve large areas, including cities. Therefore, economies of scale make electricity from fossil fuels and nuclear fuels relatively inexpensive.\n\nElectricity from sources that aren't so easily centralized, such as wind energy, have traditionally been more expensive. However, this gap has narrowed significantly as technology has improved and the cost of fossil fuels has increased.",

He laid copper wires through existing culverts to reach customers within a 2-mile radius of his power station, which could reach no farther because it operated using direct current (DC).\n\nSoon, power stations were developed that served electricity using alternating current (AC), which can be efficiently transmitted through wires hundreds of miles long. In the United States, large service territories were developed using alternating currents. Initially, each territory operated independently, but as the system grew, operators started to share resources by connecting their networks.",

      "content": ": It is indeed complex. The total length of the North American electric power grid, as developed over the past 100 years, is an estimated 450,000 miles!\n\nIt's important to understand that electricity is an on-demand commodity. When you flick on a light switch, the nearest power station instantly works a little harder to provide energy for that light. An advantage of the power grid is that if the demand for electricity at one station becomes excessive, electric power can be taken from the next nearest power station. The grid acts as a buffer, allowing peak demand at one location to be offset by lower demand at another.",

      "content": ": That's one of the disadvantages of the interconnected grid â the potential for region-wide blackouts. When a transmission line goes down due to a violent storm or equipment failure, the electrical energy that was supposed to pass through that line must go somewhere. It naturally flows into adjacent transmission lines that are already carrying heavy loads.\n\nAs this happens, the voltage peaks beyond the capacity of the power lines, which are then tripped by circuit breakers to shut down. This causes a further buildup of electrical energy in the remaining lines, which also start shutting down. This process continues at an accelerating rate until power stations can shut down their generators. Within minutes, an entire region can lose power because of a single failure at one location.",

Ideally, the power grid would be built using the latest materials and equipped with computerized sensors throughout the system to monitor energy flow. These sensors would allow for a quick and effective response to any potential issues within the grid. This is what electricity advocates call a \"smart grid.\"\n\nUnfortunately, that's not what we currently have. Instead, our \"modern\" power grid is a patchwork of wires put together over the past century.
