Let's start by looking at the two main forms of nuclear energy that were discussed in Chapter 5. There's nuclear fission, which involves splitting apart large atomic nuclei, such as uranium and plutonium. And then there's nuclear fusion, which involves combining two small atomic nuclei, such as deuterium and tritium, into a single atomic nucleus, helium. All commercially operating nuclear power plants today use nuclear fission. An important point about these plants is that they produce electrical energy without emitting atmospheric pollutants.</p></div>

And yes, all commercial nuclear power plants currently in operation use fission, not fusion.</p></div>

In addition to generating radioactive wastes, nuclear power plants pose the risk of having an accident in which radioactive material is released into the environment. The safety design of a nuclear power plant, however, has great bearing on the risks associated with generating nuclear fission energy.</p><br><p>In 1979, a nuclear reactor at a facility on Three Mile Island, near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, heated to the point that the reactor core began to melt. No appreciable radioactivity leaked into the environment, because the core was housed in a containment building.</p><br><p>Seven years later, in 1986, a total meltdown occurred at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in what is now Ukraine. Notably, the reactor core of the Chernobyl plant was not built and did not operate in accordance with internationally accepted nuclear safety principles. For example, the medium used to control the fission reactions was graphite, which loses its ability to control the reactions as the core temperature rises. Also, the reactor was not housed in a containment building. Because there was no containment building, large amounts of radiation escaped into the environment.</p></div>

Thus, pumps are needed to pass cooling water over the reactor. The operation of these pumps requires electricity, which comes from the power grid, or in a blackout, from a set of on-site diesel electric generators.</p><br><p>Unfortunately, the tsunami that came 50 minutes after the earthquake severed the plant's connection to the grid. Furthermore, the emergency generators were located in the lower levels, which were promptly flooded as the tsunami waves passed over the plant's 5.7 meter (19 feet) high seawalls.

Without power for the cooling system, the Fukushima reactors experienced a full meltdown, which means the uranium fuel turned into a molten phase and dropped to the floor of the containment building. By the next day, however, firefighter crews were able to pump seawater into the containment buildings in an effort to stop the ongoing meltdown.</p><br><p>Because of their efforts, less than a meter of the 7-meter thick concrete floor was penetrated by the meltdown material, which is to say that most of the radioactivity was contained.</p><br><p>The worst-case scenario would have occurred had the melted fuel penetrated the floor. In such a case, there would have been a massive leak of highly radioactive material into the environment. Radiation, however, was released from the venting of gases and the release of coolant. The extent of this radiation release is estimated to be about 10 percent of the Chernobyl meltdown. At both of these facilities, the efforts to clean up and contain the radioactive wastes will last for many decades.</p></div>

            <div class="content" id="content-28"><p>Yes, there have been significant improvements. Recent technological advances hold the promise of increased safety. Early reactors rely on a series of active measures, such as water pumps, that come into play to keep the reactor core cool in the event of an accident. A major drawback is that these safety devices are subject to failure, as was evident at Fukushima.</p><br><p>The Generation IV reactor designs discussed in Chapter 5 provide what is called passive stability, in which natural processes such as evaporation are used to keep the reactor core cool. Furthermore, the core has a negative temperature coefficient, which means the reactor shuts itself down as its temperature rises owing to a number of physical effects, such as any swelling of the control rods.</p></div>

Nuclear energy can seem intimidating at first, but we'll explore it together step by step. Let's start by looking at the two main forms of nuclear energy that were discussed in Chapter 5. There's nuclear fission, which involves splitting apart large atomic nuclei, such as uranium and plutonium. And then there's nuclear fusion, which involves combining two small atomic nuclei, such as deuterium and tritium, into a single atomic nucleus, helium. All commercially operating nuclear power plants today use nuclear fission. An important point about these plants is that they produce electrical energy without emitting atmospheric pollutants.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Oh, that's interesting.

And yes, all commercial nuclear power plants currently in operation use fission, not fusion.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Got it. So fission breaks things apart, fusion brings things together. When did we start using nuclear fission for electricity?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Nuclear fission energy for commercial electricity production has been with us since the 1950s. In the United States, about 20 percent of all electrical energy now comes from about 100 nuclear fission reactors located throughout the country. Other countries also depend on nuclear fission energy to varying degrees. For example, France generates about 70% of its electricity from nuclear power, while Japan generates about 22%, and Germany around 12%.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wow, 20% in the US is more than I thought!

Without an enormous and concerted conservation effort, world energy demand is going to increase, especially with growing populations and the need for economic growth in developing countries. This presents a dilemma: Should nuclear energy production come to a standstill, allowing fossil fuels to accommodate this increased energy demand? Or should we continue to operate existing nuclear power plants\u2014and even build new ones\u2014until alternative sources of energy become feasible on a large scale?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I never thought about it that way.

There are formidable disadvantages, including the creation of radioactive wastes and the possibility of an accident that would release radioactive substances into the environment.\n\nIn rebuttal, advocates point out that we cannot insist that nuclear fission energy be absolutely safe while at the same time accept hazards such as tanker spills, offshore drilling, global warming, acid rain, and coal miners' diseases.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That makes sense.

That stuff seems really dangerous.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's one of the major challenges. To date, no long-term repositories for spent nuclear fuel rods are in operation anywhere in the world, primarily because few, if any, communities want such a repository in their \"backyard.\" Furthermore, once a potential site gets chosen, extensive and time-consuming evaluations are necessary.\n\nFor example, tests at a promising site beneath Yucca Mountain in Nevada began in 1982. Some 27 years later, in 2009, after $8 billion worth of testing, this site was found to be unacceptable. Currently, spent nuclear fuel is typically stored at or close to the nuclear plant where it was generated.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So wait, there's nowhere to put all this waste permanently? That seems like a big problem.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": You've identified one of the key challenges with nuclear energy. Since 1983, the federal government has charged a small fee on every kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by nuclear power plants to finance a national disposal site. By 2009, this program had collected about $30 billion, $8 billion of which went to the study of Yucca mountain.\n\nThe World Nuclear Association has noted that \"during the next 50 years, as Earth's population expands from 7 billion toward 10 billion, humanity will consume more energy than the combined total used in all previous history. With carbon emissions now threatening the stability of the biosphere, the security of our world requires a massive transformation to clean energy. 'Renewables' like solar, wind, and biomass can help.

Those seemed really scary.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": You're right to bring up accidents. In addition to generating radioactive wastes, nuclear power plants pose the risk of having an accident in which radioactive material is released into the environment. The safety design of a nuclear power plant, however, has great bearing on the risks associated with generating nuclear fission energy.\n\nIn 1979, a nuclear reactor at a facility on Three Mile Island, near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, heated to the point that the reactor core began to melt. No appreciable radioactivity leaked into the environment, because the core was housed in a containment building.\n\nSeven years later, in 1986, a total meltdown occurred at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in what is now Ukraine. Notably, the reactor core of the Chernobyl plant was not built and did not operate in accordance with internationally accepted nuclear safety principles. For example, the medium used to control the fission reactions was graphite, which loses its ability to control the reactions as the core temperature rises. Also, the reactor was not housed in a containment building. Because there was no containment building, large amounts of radiation escaped into the environment.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's terrible. I didn't realize the Chernobyl plant didn't even have a containment building. What about Fukushima? That was more recent, right?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, the Fukushima accident happened in March 2011. A powerful 9.0 earthquake off the coast of Japan resulted in a massive tsunami 15 meters in height (49 feet). The operating nuclear reactors of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant along the coast of Japan were promptly shut down after the earthquake.\n\nThe core of any nuclear reactor, however, takes many days to cool upon being shut down. Thus, pumps are needed to pass cooling water over the reactor. The operation of these pumps requires electricity, which comes from the power grid, or in a blackout, from a set of on-site diesel electric generators.\n\nUnfortunately, the tsunami that came 50 minutes after the earthquake severed the plant's connection to the grid. Furthermore, the emergency generators were located in the lower levels, which were promptly flooded as the tsunami waves passed over the plant's 5.7 meter (19 feet) high seawalls. The result was a deadly nuclear disaster.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So the backup systems were in the basement, and they got flooded? That seems like a design flaw...", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a very astute observation. Without power for the cooling system, the Fukushima reactors experienced a full meltdown, which means the uranium fuel turned into a molten phase and dropped to the floor of the containment building. By the next day, however, firefighter crews were able to pump seawater into the containment buildings in an effort to stop the ongoing meltdown.\n\nBecause of their efforts, less than a meter of the 7-meter thick concrete floor was penetrated by the meltdown material, which is to say that most of the radioactivity was contained.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would have occurred had the melted fuel penetrated the floor. In such a case, there would have been a massive leak of highly radioactive material into the environment. Radiation, however, was released from the venting of gases and the release of coolant. The extent of this radiation release is estimated to be about 10 percent of the Chernobyl meltdown. At both of these facilities, the efforts to clean up and contain the radioactive wastes will last for many decades.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": This is fascinating, but honestly a bit scary too. Are they making nuclear plants safer now after these accidents?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, there have been significant improvements. Recent technological advances hold the promise of increased safety. Early reactors rely on a series of active measures, such as water pumps, that come into play to keep the reactor core cool in the event of an accident. A major drawback is that these safety devices are subject to failure, as was evident at Fukushima.\n\nThe Generation IV reactor designs discussed in Chapter 5 provide what is called passive stability, in which natural processes such as evaporation are used to keep the reactor core cool. Furthermore, the core has a negative temperature coefficient, which means the reactor shuts itself down as its temperature rises owing to a number of physical effects, such as any swelling of the control rods.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That makes sense \u2013 so newer designs could shut themselves down automatically without needing pumps or power. So what's happening with nuclear power globally? Are we using more or less of it?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": The percentage of the world's electricity produced by fission reactors in 2010 stood at about 15 percent. By 2020 this had dropped to about 10 percent, the difference being picked up by renewable energy sources, most notably wind. Ideally, renewables will continue to edge their way into the scene to help meet growing energy demand.\n\nAt issue, however, is that this demand is set to grow significantly. Total worldwide electricity consumption is projected to increase dramatically through 2050, with the greatest expansion set to occur in Asia. Asia represents over half the world population, and yet the majority of people there currently remain underserved. If new nuclear power plants are not built, will renewables be able to keep up with this demand? If not, the only alternative would be to build additional air-polluting fossil fuel power plants.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I think I'm starting to understand the big picture better now.
