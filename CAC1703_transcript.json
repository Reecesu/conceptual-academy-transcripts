Let's start by looking at the two main forms of nuclear energy that were discussed in Chapter 5. There's nuclear fission, which involves splitting apart large atomic nuclei, such as uranium and plutonium. And then there's nuclear fusion, which involves combining two small atomic nuclei, such as deuterium and tritium, into a single atomic nucleus, helium. All commercially operating nuclear power plants today use nuclear fission. An important point about these plants is that they produce electrical energy without emitting atmospheric pollutants.",

Some 27 years later, in 2009, after $8 billion worth of testing, this site was found to be unacceptable. Currently, spent nuclear fuel is typically stored at or close to the nuclear plant where it was generated.",

With carbon emissions now threatening the stability of the biosphere, the security of our world requires a massive transformation to clean energy. 'Renewables' like solar, wind, and biomass can help.

In addition to generating radioactive wastes, nuclear power plants pose the risk of having an accident in which radioactive material is released into the environment. The safety design of a nuclear power plant, however, has great bearing on the risks associated with generating nuclear fission energy.\n\nIn 1979, a nuclear reactor at a facility on Three Mile Island, near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, heated to the point that the reactor core began to melt. No appreciable radioactivity leaked into the environment, because the core was housed in a containment building.\n\nSeven years later, in 1986, a total meltdown occurred at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in what is now Ukraine. Notably, the reactor core of the Chernobyl plant was not built and did not operate in accordance with internationally accepted nuclear safety principles. For example, the medium used to control the fission reactions was graphite, which loses its ability to control the reactions as the core temperature rises. Also, the reactor was not housed in a containment building. Because there was no containment building, large amounts of radiation escaped into the environment.",

The operating nuclear reactors of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant along the coast of Japan were promptly shut down after the earthquake.\n\nThe core of any nuclear reactor, however, takes many days to cool upon being shut down. Thus, pumps are needed to pass cooling water over the reactor. The operation of these pumps requires electricity, which comes from the power grid, or in a blackout, from a set of on-site diesel electric generators.\n\nUnfortunately, the tsunami that came 50 minutes after the earthquake severed the plant's connection to the grid. Furthermore, the emergency generators were located in the lower levels, which were promptly flooded as the tsunami waves passed over the plant's 5.7 meter (19 feet) high seawalls. The result was a deadly nuclear disaster.",

      "content": ": That's a very astute observation. Without power for the cooling system, the Fukushima reactors experienced a full meltdown, which means the uranium fuel turned into a molten phase and dropped to the floor of the containment building. By the next day, however, firefighter crews were able to pump seawater into the containment buildings in an effort to stop the ongoing meltdown.\n\nBecause of their efforts, less than a meter of the 7-meter thick concrete floor was penetrated by the meltdown material, which is to say that most of the radioactivity was contained.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would have occurred had the melted fuel penetrated the floor. In such a case, there would have been a massive leak of highly radioactive material into the environment. Radiation, however, was released from the venting of gases and the release of coolant. The extent of this radiation release is estimated to be about 10 percent of the Chernobyl meltdown. At both of these facilities, the efforts to clean up and contain the radioactive wastes will last for many decades.",

      "content": ": Yes, there have been significant improvements. Recent technological advances hold the promise of increased safety. Early reactors rely on a series of active measures, such as water pumps, that come into play to keep the reactor core cool in the event of an accident. A major drawback is that these safety devices are subject to failure, as was evident at Fukushima.\n\nThe Generation IV reactor designs discussed in Chapter 5 provide what is called passive stability, in which natural processes such as evaporation are used to keep the reactor core cool. Furthermore, the core has a negative temperature coefficient, which means the reactor shuts itself down as its temperature rises owing to a number of physical effects, such as any swelling of the control rods.",

By 2020 this had dropped to about 10 percent, the difference being picked up by renewable energy sources, most notably wind. Ideally, renewables will continue to edge their way into the scene to help meet growing energy demand.\n\nAt issue, however, is that this demand is set to grow significantly. Total worldwide electricity consumption is projected to increase dramatically through 2050, with the greatest expansion set to occur in Asia. Asia represents over half the world population, and yet the majority of people there currently remain underserved. If new nuclear power plants are not built, will renewables be able to keep up with this demand? If not, the only alternative would be to build additional air-polluting fossil fuel power plants.",
