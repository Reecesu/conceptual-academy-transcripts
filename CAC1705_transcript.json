When water flows through a hydroelectric dam, it rotates a turbine that spins an electric generator to produce electricity.\n\nModern hydroelectric facilities can be remarkably efficient - converting kinetic energy to electrical energy with up to 95% efficiency. This high efficiency translates to lower costs for consumers. Another advantage is that hydroelectric power is clean, producing no pollutants such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and other waste materials.",

The Sun drives what we call the hydrologic cycle - it evaporates water from oceans and lakes, which then falls as precipitation at higher elevations in mountains. The gravitational potential energy of this elevated water is what we capture with dams. So it's solar energy that transports water to mountain elevations through this cycle.\n\nIn the United States, hydroelectric power is the most widely used form of sustainable energy, supplying about 10 percent of our electricity needs. In developing countries, it supplies an even larger share - around 30 percent of all electricity needs.",

Of the approximately 80,000 existing dams in the United States, only about 2,400 are currently used to generate power. Many of these \"untapped\" dams could be fitted with turbines and generators.\n\nAdditionally, most hydroelectric dams in the United States were built in the 1940s, when equipment wasn't as efficient as today's technology. Upgrading these older plants with new technologies would allow them to operate more efficiently and produce more electricity. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that just a 1 percent improvement in the efficiency of existing U.S. hydropower plants would produce enough power to supply 283,000 households.",

Fish and wildlife habitats can be significantly impacted. One tragic consequence of some dams is that they prevent fish from reaching their spawning grounds, causing fish populations to decline.\n\nTo address this concern, many dams have been retrofitted with fish \"ladders\" that are supposed to encourage upstream migration to spawning grounds. However, the success of these ladders has been limited.\n\nThere are other environmental issues too. Reservoirs created by dams tend to fill with silt, affecting water quality and limiting the life span of the dam. Dams can detract from the natural beauty of a river, and in many cases, valuable downstream cropland is lost or disrupted while upstream land habitats are flooded. Dams also need to be well maintained and inspected regularly to minimize the potential of a break.",

This, combined with another 82,000 megawatts from other hydroelectric projects, provides an estimated 30 percent of China's electricity.\n\nThe dam is massive - it extends 2.2 kilometers across, creating a reservoir 600 kilometers long. However, the project had significant social impacts as well. The flooding of this reservoir displaced about 1.2 million people, which highlights some of the complex trade-offs involved in large hydroelectric projects.",

      "content": ": Yes, there are several other methods of harnessing energy from water. Let's talk about one called ocean thermal energy conversion, or OTEC. This process exploits the temperature difference between surface seawater, which is warmer, and deep seawater, which is colder.\n\nHere's how it works: warm surface water is used to boil a liquid that has a low boiling point, such as ammonia. The resulting high-pressure vapor pushes against a turbine, and the movement of the turbine generates electricity. After passing through the turbine, the vapor enters a condenser, where it's exposed to pipes containing cold water pumped up from great ocean depths. As its temperature drops, the vapor condenses to a liquid, creating a partial vacuum that further enhances the rotation of the turbine. The condensed liquid is then recycled through the system.",

      "content": ": I understand it can seem complex at first. Think of it this way: it's similar to how a steam engine works, but instead of burning fuel to create temperature differences, OTEC uses natural temperature differences in the ocean.\n\nThe warm surface water provides the heat to vaporize the working fluid (like ammonia), and the cold deep water provides the cooling to condense it back to liquid. This cycle of evaporation and condensation is what drives the turbine. It's essentially converting the ocean's thermal energy into mechanical energy, which then becomes electrical energy.",

That's a great recall.\n\nOTEC is limited to regions where differences between ocean surface temperatures and deep-water temperatures are greatest. Some have proposed fleets of floating off-shore rigs, with the electricity generated used to produce transportable hydrogen fuel made from seawater.\n\nOnshore OTEC plants are best suited for islands such as Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico, where deep waters are relatively close to shore. The world's first OTEC plant has been running in Hawaii since 1990, producing about 210 kilowatts of electricity. Most of this electricity is used by a local aquaculture industry, which uses the nutrient-rich deep ocean water piped by the OTEC unit to breed specialty fishes and crustaceans for the U.S. and Japanese markets. Interestingly, the piped cold water is also used to air-condition the OTEC offices and laboratories.",

So indeed, like hydroelectric dams, OTEC traces back to the Sun as its original energy source.",

In some areas, this heat comes relatively close to the Earth's surface. When this heat pokes through, we see it as lava from a volcano or steam from a geyser. This is geothermal energy, and it can be tapped for our benefit.\n\nOne form of geothermal energy is hydrothermal energy, which is produced by pumping naturally occurring hot water or steam from the ground. It's the predominant form of geothermal energy now being used commercially for electricity generation. Californians currently receive about 12,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity from hydrothermal power plants, which accounts for about 6 percent of the state's electricity needs. There are about 200 hydrothermal power plants in the United States and many more in Italy, New Zealand, and Iceland.",

Besides generating electricity, hydrothermal energy is used directly to heat buildings. Across the United States, geothermal hot water reservoirs are much more common than geothermal steam reservoirs. Most of the untapped hot water reservoirs are in California, Nevada, Utah, and New Mexico. \n\nThe temperatures of these reservoirs are not hot enough to drive steam turbines efficiently, but the water is used to boil a secondary fluid, such as butane, whose vapors then drive gas turbines.",

The Earth's interior is warm largely because of radioactive decay of elements like uranium, thorium, and potassium deep within the Earth. This radioactive decay produces heat, which is what creates the high temperatures underground that we harness through geothermal energy.\n\nThe water in the Blue Lagoon isn't dangerously radioactive, but the heat energy that warms it originally comes from this radioactive decay in the Earth's interior. It's an interesting chemical connection that shows how different processes in nature are linked together.",

These systems take advantage of the fact that as little as 5 meters below the Earth's surface, the temperature remains nearly constant year round.\n\nFor example, in New England, the ground at this depth remains at about 8°C (46°F) all year. During winter, ground water can be pumped into a basement heat exchanger, where it causes a low boiling-point material, such as freon, to evaporate. This cools the water down to about 4°C (39°F) but adds energy to the freon. The gaseous freon is then pumped to a network of baffles, where it condenses, releasing its heat to a second system of water that is piped through the floors of the house.\n\nRepeated cycles of the heat exchanger can warm the second system of water to up to 50°C (122°F), which is sufficient to keep the house warm through the winter. This variation of geothermal heating is applicable to nearly any home or business with a backyard.\n\nInterestingly, the source of this energy is actually solar, not geothermal in the strict sense.

So while we call these systems \"geothermal\" heat pumps in common usage, they're technically using stored solar energy in the ground rather than the deep geothermal heat from the Earth's interior. Great reasoning!\n\nThere's another form of geothermal energy called hot dry rock energy. This involves using hydraulic pressure to open up a large reservoir deep underground. Liquid water is injected into the reservoir, heated by the hot rock, and then brought back to the surface as steam to generate electricity.",

This salty water is highly corrosive, and its disposal is a problem. Furthermore, water extracted from deep below is usually contaminated with radioactivity.

The side of the Earth closest to the Moon experiences the greatest pull, and the side farthest away experiences the weakest pull. The result of this uneven pull is a subtle, planetwide elongation of our oceans. As the Earth spins underneath this elongation, Earth-bound observers notice a perpetual rise and fall of sea level. These are our ocean tides, and they can be harnessed for energy.\n\nTidal power is normally obtained from the filling and emptying of a bay or an estuary, which may be closed in by a dam. When tidal waters flow through the dam (in either direction), they cause a paddle wheel or turbine to rotate, and this motion generates electricity.",

The Sun's gravity also plays a smaller role in creating tides, which is why we have especially high \"spring tides\" when the Sun and Moon align.\n\nAs for tidal power plants, the prospects for using tidal power on a large scale are not good. In order to be effective, the tidal range (the difference between high and low tide) must be relatively great. This severely limits the number of potential sites worldwide. Furthermore, many of these potential sites are praised for their natural beauty. In such cases, public opposition to building a power plant would be strong.\n\nNonetheless, tidal power is an option some communities may want to consider. One successful site is located in Brittany, a region of France. Known as the Rance Tidal Power Station, it produces about 240 megawatts of electricity. It works by allowing water to flow through turbines as the tide rises and falls on either side of a barrier.",
