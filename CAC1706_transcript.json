And here's an important environmental benefit: if biomass is produced at a sustainable rate, the carbon dioxide released when it is burned balances the carbon dioxide consumed during photosynthesis.",

However, when biomass is grown sustainably, it creates a closed carbon cycle. The plants absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, and then release it when burned. So there's no net increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.\n\nThis is different from fossil fuels, where we're releasing carbon that was stored millions of years ago. Additionally, biomass combustion products generally contain about one-third the ash produced by coal and about one-thirtieth the sulfur, making it cleaner in several ways.",

The alcohol provides an octane boost, allowing an engine to run more efficiently with less pollution.

Of that, the United States was the leading producer (53 billion L) followed by Brazil (30 billion L). While ethanol is produced in the United States primarily from the fermentation of corn, in Brazil, it is produced primarily from the fermentation of sugar cane.\n\nBrazil started its ethanol for fuel program decades ago in response to the oil crisis of the 1970s. Up until 2005, it was the world's leading producer. Notably, most vehicles in Brazil are equipped to run using E100, which is all ethanol containing no fossil fuels. Thus, the carbon dioxide produced from these vehicles is offset by the carbon dioxide absorbed by the growing sugar cane.",

Ethanol from fermentation is relatively expensive because of the great financial and environmental costs of growing food biomass, a process that requires vast amounts of water and fertilizer.\n\nYou're right that using food crops for fuel can create competition with food supplies. This is called the \"food versus fuel\" debate. Ethanol derived from petroleum is actually less expensive, but only because crude oil prices are kept artificially low. If taxpayer subsidies, exemptions from paying for the environmental damage from mining and drilling, and the cost of military protection are factored in, the price of crude oil quadruples.",

The ultimate starting material for the creation of ethanol is cellulose, which is the world's most abundant organic chemical, found in all plants. The idea is to break cellulose down to its glucose monomers, which can then be fermented to form ethanol.\n\nAs you may have learned in biology, cellulose found in plants is tightly locked. This is important for a plant's structural rigidity, but it makes it very difficult to break down the cellulose into glucose. Nonetheless, much research is being conducted to discover ways in which this can be done in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner.",

An advantage of cellulosic ethanol is that it does not use up food-stocks such as corn and sugar that could be used instead to help alleviate world hunger, which addresses the concern you raised earlier.",

Converting biomass to a transportable fuel is an extra step that decreases energy efficiency. Higher efficiencies are obtained by burning the biomass directly to produce electricity, also known as biopower.\n\nMost biopower is generated by paper companies and forest products companies using wood and wood wastes as fuel. Some municipalities use solid-waste incinerators that provide electricity and waste disposal simultaneously. On average, about 80 percent of the dry weight of municipal solid waste is combustible organic material.",

The traditional approach to generating electricity from biomass is to burn the biomass in a boiler, where water is converted to steam used to drive a steam turbine.\n\nBut efficiency can be more than doubled by first converting the biomass to a gaseous fuel, which may be done by applying air and steam at high pressure. Alternatively, gaseous fuels are also produced by mixing the biomass with very hot sand, as is done at a facility in Vermont. The gaseous fuel is burned, and the hot combustion products are directed to a gas turbine that generates electricity. In addition, the exhaust gases from the turbine can be used to produce steam for industrial applications or for additional power generation.",

Consider that about half of all biopower within the United States is generated within California. The production of biopower in California has remained fairly steady, while electric power from photovoltaics and wind have grown remarkably.",
