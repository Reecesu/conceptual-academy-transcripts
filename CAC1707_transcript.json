      "content": ": Those roof panels could be one of two types - either solar thermal collectors for heating water or photovoltaic panels for generating electricity. Let's start with solar heat collection.\n\nSolar heat is actually quite easy to collect. Whether you live in a hot or cold climate, you can conserve energy by taking advantage of the Sun's rays. Did you know that a typical household uses about 15 percent of its total energy consumption just to heat water for bathing, washing dishes, and clothes? This energy could just as well come from the Sun rather than from your local electric power plant or natural gas supplier.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": A solar energy collector for heating water is actually quite simple in design. It's not much more than a black metal box covered with a glass plate. Sunlight passes through the glass into the box, where it's absorbed by the black metal. This metal becomes hot and emits infrared radiation. Since glass is opaque to infrared, these rays stay trapped in the box. Water passing through pipes within the box is heated by this trapped warmth.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's an excellent comparison! Your car does indeed work on the same principle - sunlight enters through the windows, is absorbed by your car's interior surfaces, and is converted to heat that can't escape through the glass. This is sometimes called the \"greenhouse effect\" in this context.\n\nIn a proper solar collector, water that has passed through a series of these collectors can become scalding hot. This water can be stored in well-insulated containers and used for washing purposes. Additionally, air passing over coils of solar-heated water becomes warm and may be used to heat buildings.",

The solar thermal collectors are specifically designed to heat water and are indeed often painted black to maximize the absorption of solar heat. Figure 17.32 in your textbook shows examples of these collectors - they're typically mounted on rooftops where they can receive maximum sunlight.\n\nNow, would you like to learn about how sunlight can be used to generate electricity through solar thermal electric generation?",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": I understand the confusion. There are actually different technologies for using solar energy.\n\nSolar thermal electric generation is a collection of technologies that produce electricity from sunlight. One approach involves pumping a synthetic oil through a pipe positioned near a mirror-coated trough. The mirror focuses sunlight onto the pipe, heating the oil to extremely high temperatures - about 370°C. This hot oil is then used to generate steam, which turns a turbine to generate electricity. During periods of high demand, cloudy weather, or nighttime, a natural gas burner can provide supplemental heat.",

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes, exactly! The mirrors concentrate the sunlight to create much higher temperatures than would be possible with direct sunlight alone. This concentration allows us to generate enough heat to produce steam for electricity generation.\n\nAnother solar thermal electric technology involves a large array of sun-tracking mirrors reflecting sunlight onto the top of a central tower. With this design, the temperature at the focal point can soar to about 2200°C. The solar heat is then carried away by a molten salt mixture, primarily sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate (commonly called saltpeter).",

      "feedback": null
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": You're right - 2200°C is extremely hot! The hot molten salt is piped to an insulated tank, where the solar thermal energy can be stored for up to a week. This is one of the key advantages of this approach. When electricity is needed, the molten salt is pumped to a conventional steam-generating system to produce electricity. After transferring its heat, the cooled salt recirculates back to the central tower for reheating.\n\nThe world's largest commercial central-tower solar thermal energy plant is located in southern Spain. It started operating in 2011 and generates about 20 MW of electricity, which is enough to power about 27,500 homes. The central tower is 140 meters tall and is surrounded by 2650 sun-tracking mirrors, each measuring 120 square meters.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": Yes, wind power is actually considered a form of direct solar energy, and it's currently the cheapest form! This may seem surprising at first, but wind is caused by the Sun heating the Earth unevenly, which creates air movement.\n\nWind power is relatively simple in concept—wind blows on a wind turbine, and the rotation of the turbine blades generates electricity. Most of the early development of wind power in the United States took place in California during the 1980s due to favorable tax incentives.",

Today, most of these problems have been resolved, and the reliability, performance, and cost of wind power have improved dramatically.\n\nIn regions where wind speed averages 13 miles per hour, the operating cost of wind-generated electricity now stands at about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour. What's particularly interesting is that unlike conventional energy sources whose prices keep going up, the cost of wind energy has been coming down. Within a decade, it may well drop below 1 cent per kilowatt-hour, which is significantly cheaper than electricity from conventional sources such as coal.",

This would require an expensive infrastructure of new transmission lines to be built. \n\nAlternatively, electricity from wind could be used to create hydrogen through the electrolysis of water, which we'll discuss in a later section.",

Additionally, the turbines on smaller windmills rotate relatively fast, which can pose a hazard for birds.\n\nModern wind turbines also require powerful magnets to transform wind energy to electrical energy. The rare earth metals used to make these magnets are a limited resource, which adds to the cost.\n\nAlso, all windmills must be manufactured, which requires materials and energy. But on the positive side, this means more jobs for skilled labor.",

Any drawbacks to wind energy need to be considered against the benefit of reduced dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nInterestingly, some people have suggested that if we look fondly on the classic windmills of Holland, perhaps these new-age windmills might one day be looked upon as an attractive sign of prosperity. Fortunately, much of the wind-rich land in the United States is farmland, and wind power and agricultural activities are compatible. At the Altamont wind farms in California, ranchers lost only about 5 percent of their grazing area, but their land prices quadrupled because of royalties they receive from wind power companies using their land.",

In this way, the turbine owner is able to \"bank\" the energy collected on windy days for use on days when the wind speed is too low.",

As you may have learned in an earlier chapter, photovoltaic cells directly convert light into electricity.\n\nSince their invention in the 1950s, photovoltaics have made remarkable strides. The first major application was in the 1960s in the U.S. space program—space satellites carried photovoltaic cells to power radios and other small electronic devices. Photovoltaics gained further momentum during the energy crisis of the mid-1970s.",

Photovoltaic cells can be made in various sizes to accommodate different applications, from tiny cells in calculators to large arrays on rooftops or in solar farms.\n\nThe cost of receiving electricity through photovoltaics is primarily a function of the cost of purchasing the equipment and having it installed. As of 2020, a residential 2-kilowatt photovoltaic system costs about $5,000, which is down significantly from about $14,000 in 2012.",

Also, photovoltaics, as well as all other sustainable energy sources, become more attractive as the cost of purchasing electricity from fossil fuel–based utility companies continues to rise.\n\nFurthermore, the price of photovoltaic systems continues to drop as the technology improves. Beyond economic reasons, many people are switching to photovoltaic systems simply because they are a clean source of energy and are good for the environment.\n\nToday's average residential photovoltaic system has an estimated life span of 25 years. Worldwide, sales of photovoltaics have grown exponentially over the last several decades, and they're now a multi-billion-dollar industry with a strong promise of continued growth.",

They're also becoming cost-competitive with electricity from fossil and nuclear fuels.\n\nPhotovoltaics are incredibly versatile.
