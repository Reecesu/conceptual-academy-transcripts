Let's start by discussing why hydrogen is considered an ideal fuel.</p><br><p>By weight, hydrogen packs more energy than any other fuel, which is why it's used to launch spacecraft. It can be readily produced from the electrolysis of water, and the electrolysis equipment can be powered by solar-derived electricity. This way, hydrogen provides a convenient means of storing solar energy, which classifies it as a solar fuel.</p></div>

Solar panels (or photovoltaics) generate electricity directly, but that electricity needs to be used immediately or stored somehow. Hydrogen offers us a way to store that energy in chemical form.</p><br><p>When hydrogen burns, it produces almost nothing but water vapor. This energetic vapor can drive gas turbines to produce electricity. Any waste heat can be used for industrial purposes or to warm buildings.

In fact, pumping hydrogen through pipelines is more energy efficient than transmitting electricity through power lines.

When you press the gas pedal of a hydrogen-powered car, it sends a warming electric current to this alloy, which is housed in the gas tank. As the alloy heats up, it releases hydrogen, which powers either an internal-combustion engine or an electricity-producing fuel cell.

Utilities could produce megawatts of electricity by stacking fuel cells. Present-day fuel cells have an efficiency of about 60 percent, which is well above the 34 percent efficiency of a typical coal-fired power plant.</p><br><p>Interestingly, one potential source of hydrogen is coal, which when treated with high-pressure steam and oxygen produces hydrogen gas and methane gas. Burning these gases in a gas turbine results in a coal-to-electricity efficiency as high as 42 percent. If the gases are first run through electricity-producing fuel cells, the efficiency is even higher. Meanwhile, because the coal is not burned directly, fewer pollutants are released into the environment.</p></div>

Nearly a quarter of all U.S. facilities that generate electric power will need major renovations, overhauls, or replacement within the next few years. This represents an opportunity for the development of sustainable energy sources.</p><br><p>Even greater opportunities exist in developing nations, where there are more than 2 billion people without electricity and many more to come with population growth. Much money will be spent to bring electric power to these people. Immediate choices made about where that energy comes from and how it is produced will affect the environment for a long time to come.</p></div>

Conservation measures can be quite effective, as was demonstrated after the Arab oil embargo imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1973. From the start of this embargo until 1986, energy consumption in the United States remained constant as a result of increased efficiency while the economy grew by 30 percent.</p></div>

I'm Alia, and I'm here to support the learning of core science concepts. Let's get started. How can I help you today?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Hi Alia. I need to learn about alternative energy sources for my environmental science class. I've always been pretty bad at science, so I'm a bit nervous about this topic. My professor mentioned something about hydrogen fuel?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": I understand your concern, but don't worry\u2014we'll work through this together! Hydrogen fuel is actually a fascinating topic. Let's start by discussing why hydrogen is considered an ideal fuel.\n\nBy weight, hydrogen packs more energy than any other fuel, which is why it's used to launch spacecraft. It can be readily produced from the electrolysis of water, and the electrolysis equipment can be powered by solar-derived electricity. This way, hydrogen provides a convenient means of storing solar energy, which classifies it as a solar fuel.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wait, so hydrogen can store solar energy? I thought solar energy just came from those panels on roofs and that's it.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a common misconception. Solar panels (or photovoltaics) generate electricity directly, but that electricity needs to be used immediately or stored somehow. Hydrogen offers us a way to store that energy in chemical form.\n\nWhen hydrogen burns, it produces almost nothing but water vapor. This energetic vapor can drive gas turbines to produce electricity. Any waste heat can be used for industrial purposes or to warm buildings. The water that condenses from the turbine can be used for agriculture, human consumption, or recycled to produce more hydrogen.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That sounds almost too good to be true. If it's so clean and efficient, why aren't we using it everywhere already?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a great question! While hydrogen has many advantages, there are still technical and economic hurdles to overcome. But let's continue exploring its benefits first.\n\nBecause hydrogen is a gas, it's easily transported through pipelines. In fact, pumping hydrogen through pipelines is more energy efficient than transmitting electricity through power lines. This means hydrogen facilities could be located in regions where production is cheapest\u2014desert regions for solar thermal and photovoltaics, windy regions for wind turbines, and moist regions for biomass\u2014and then transported to meet energy needs of distant communities.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I've never thought about energy that way before. So different regions could specialize in the type of renewable energy that works best there?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Exactly! That's one of the advantages of a flexible system. Hydrogen can even be used as a fuel for automobiles.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Cars that run on hydrogen? How would that even work? I can't imagine filling my car with gas that's lighter than air!", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": It's quite innovative actually. Porous metal alloys have been developed that absorb large quantities of hydrogen gas. When you press the gas pedal of a hydrogen-powered car, it sends a warming electric current to this alloy, which is housed in the gas tank. As the alloy heats up, it releases hydrogen, which powers either an internal-combustion engine or an electricity-producing fuel cell. Gas stations of the future may truly be \"gas\" stations!", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's pretty cool! But wait\u2014I thought cars produced carbon dioxide. How does burning hydrogen not create CO2?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a perfect question. Why do you think the combustion of hydrogen produces no carbon dioxide?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Hmm... Well, I guess because hydrogen doesn't have carbon in it? Regular gas comes from oil which has carbon, but hydrogen is just... hydrogen?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's absolutely correct! There is no carbon with which to form carbon dioxide. Hydrogen is an ideal fuel that, when burned, produces almost nothing but water vapor\u2014no carbon dioxide, no carbon monoxide, and no particulate matter. That's why it's considered so clean.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That makes sense! I feel like I'm understanding chemistry better than I thought I would. So if hydrogen is so great, how do we get electricity from it efficiently?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": As we discussed in a previous section (Section 11.4), an efficient way to produce electricity from hydrogen or any other fuel is with a fuel cell. Utilities could produce megawatts of electricity by stacking fuel cells. Present-day fuel cells have an efficiency of about 60 percent, which is well above the 34 percent efficiency of a typical coal-fired power plant.\n\nInterestingly, one potential source of hydrogen is coal, which when treated with high-pressure steam and oxygen produces hydrogen gas and methane gas. Burning these gases in a gas turbine results in a coal-to-electricity efficiency as high as 42 percent. If the gases are first run through electricity-producing fuel cells, the efficiency is even higher. Meanwhile, because the coal is not burned directly, fewer pollutants are released into the environment.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wait, we can get hydrogen from coal? I thought coal was one of the worst polluters. That seems contradictory.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": You're right to question that. Coal is indeed a major polluter when burned directly. However, when processed properly to extract hydrogen, it creates fewer emissions than traditional coal burning. That said, can you think of an even cleaner and more abundant source of hydrogen on our planet?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Um... maybe water? Since water is H2O, and we want the H part?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Excellent! The cleanest and most abundant source of hydrogen on our planet is indeed water. Creating hydrogen from water is an energy-intensive process, however, that is best done using electrolysis, a technique we discussed in Section 11.6.\n\nIdeally, the electrical energy required to create hydrogen from water could be provided by a solar-driven photovoltaic cell. The electricity generated by the cell is then sent to a second cell, where water is electrolytically cleaved to produce hydrogen. Current \"solar fuel\" research seeks to develop photovoltaic surfaces that directly generate hydrogen from water, as shown in textbook Figure 17.41.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": So we'd use solar energy to split water molecules? That sounds complicated. I'm having trouble visualizing how efficient that would be.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": It's a valid concern. Over the past several years, there has been great progress toward commercially feasible solar-energy-to-hydrogen systems. For such systems, the efficiency at which solar energy is converted to hydrogen needs to be as high as possible.\n\nInitial systems had efficiencies of no more than 6 percent. One of the main hurdles was developing a photovoltaic system optimized for 1.23 volts, which is the voltage needed for the hydrolysis of water. Such a system was developed by 1998 and provided an efficiency of 12.4 percent. With newer nanotechnologies now under development, researchers are anticipating efficiencies in excess of 60 percent.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wow, from 6% to potentially 60%? That's a huge improvement! I guess technology really is advancing quickly in this area.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": It certainly is! And if hydrogen can be efficiently produced using electricity from photovoltaics or wind turbines, then a number of interesting possibilities arise.\n\nPhotovoltaics and wind turbines are \"distributed\" sources of energy, as opposed to \"centralized\" sources. In other words, they can be placed in people's backyards or in neighborhood solar energy parks, in contrast to a centralized coal-fired power plant.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Oh, I get it! So instead of one big power plant, we could have lots of smaller energy producers. Kind of like how people now have solar panels on their houses?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Precisely! The solar electricity and hydrogen can thus be produced at the point of use, thereby avoiding energy losses inherent in shipping energy over long distances. Such a system would not likely put the centralized utility out of business; instead, it would help the utility cope with ever-increasing energy demands.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the greatest energy growths for the next century will be occurring in developing nations where the infrastructure for centralized energy sources does not exist. Starting people off in these countries with noncentralized and nonpolluting sustainable energy sources would be a worthwhile investment.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": I never thought about how developing countries might skip the whole coal/oil phase we went through. That makes a lot of sense!", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Yes, it's an important perspective to consider. Let's put this all in a broader context. Nearly a quarter of all U.S. facilities that generate electric power will need major renovations, overhauls, or replacement within the next few years. This represents an opportunity for the development of sustainable energy sources.\n\nEven greater opportunities exist in developing nations, where there are more than 2 billion people without electricity and many more to come with population growth. Much money will be spent to bring electric power to these people. Immediate choices made about where that energy comes from and how it is produced will affect the environment for a long time to come.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": It's kind of overwhelming to think about. With so many people needing electricity, can we really meet that demand with sustainable sources?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": It's a valid concern. All regions of the world will benefit from energy conservation, which is the natural partner of sustainable energy. Conservation measures can be quite effective, as was demonstrated after the Arab oil embargo imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1973. From the start of this embargo until 1986, energy consumption in the United States remained constant as a result of increased efficiency while the economy grew by 30 percent.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's impressive that we kept energy use flat while the economy grew! Are we close to maxing out how much we can conserve?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Not at all. New technologies and materials suggest there is still much we can do. Super-insulated buildings, for example, now require only one-tenth as much heating in winter and cooling in summer. Hybrid combustion\u2013electric vehicles can now drive up to 100 miles per gallon (mpg), which is a big step up from the average U.S. fuel efficiency of about 25 mpg.\n\nIf you were to replace a single 60-watt incandescent bulb with an equivalent 8-watt LED light, you would be saving the release of about 1800 kg of carbon dioxide each year, assuming a fossil fuel power plant. This LED light would also be about 90 percent cheaper to operate.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Wow, I had no idea one light bulb could make that much difference! I always thought my individual actions were too small to matter.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": That's a common misconception. Consider a scenario where just about every voter in an election felt their single vote made no difference and, therefore, they did not vote. In such a case, the results of the election would be determined by a select few. The results would not be representative.\n\nThis is why for a democracy to work, it's important to nurture the attitude of each vote being exceedingly important. Conversely, the easiest way to defeat a democracy would be to nurture an attitude of voter apathy.\n\nSo, do the minor energy conservation efforts of one individual make a difference? Very much so. Why? Because we live on a planet of about 8 billion individuals and counting. We each have only one voice, but we live in a choir of voices. The attitude of the individual is everything.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's a really powerful analogy. I never thought about my energy use like voting before, but it makes sense. So what are the big picture numbers on our energy needs?", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": Our energy needs are increasing for two main reasons: 1) because of our increasing population, and 2) because there are still many who are underserved but now demanding service.\n\nThe data in Table 17.1 from the textbook assumes that an acceptable standard of living can be had at 0.0030 megawatt per person. On average, however, the 1.2 billion individuals of developed nations, such as the United States, consume about 0.0075 megawatt per person.\n\nIf conservation measures are not set in place and if the far greater number of individuals in developing nations is brought up to 0.0075 megawatt per person, then the world will use 75 million megawatts in 2050 and 112 million megawatts in 2100, six times the amount consumed in 2000.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": That's a lot of energy! And developing countries deserve their fair share too. This feels like a really big challenge.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": It certainly is a challenge. Bottom line: If we are to meet the energy needs of the many, conservation efforts are imperative. We cannot just come to rely on new technologies to save the day. As within many areas, it is our attitudes that make the biggest difference.\n\nThomas Jefferson described revolution as an extraordinary event necessary to enable all ordinary events to continue. If a decent standard of living for all human beings is to be held as ordinary, what we need is nothing short of an energy revolution. The days of our using nonrenewable energy sources are numbered. The sooner we make the necessary transitions to a sustainable future, the better.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": You know, I came into this conversation feeling pretty intimidated by science, but I actually understand a lot more about hydrogen fuel and sustainable energy now. It's not just about the technology but about our choices as a society. That makes more sense to me.", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ": I'm really glad to hear that! Science becomes much more meaningful when we connect it to our lives and society. You've made some excellent observations today. As the textbook concludes: Good chemistry to you!", "image_summary": false, "feedback": null}, {"role": "user", "content": ": Thanks Alia!
