      "content": ": I understand your concern, but don't worry—we'll work through this together! Hydrogen fuel is actually a fascinating topic. Let's start by discussing why hydrogen is considered an ideal fuel.\n\nBy weight, hydrogen packs more energy than any other fuel, which is why it's used to launch spacecraft. It can be readily produced from the electrolysis of water, and the electrolysis equipment can be powered by solar-derived electricity. This way, hydrogen provides a convenient means of storing solar energy, which classifies it as a solar fuel.",

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's a common misconception. Solar panels (or photovoltaics) generate electricity directly, but that electricity needs to be used immediately or stored somehow. Hydrogen offers us a way to store that energy in chemical form.\n\nWhen hydrogen burns, it produces almost nothing but water vapor. This energetic vapor can drive gas turbines to produce electricity. Any waste heat can be used for industrial purposes or to warm buildings. The water that condenses from the turbine can be used for agriculture, human consumption, or recycled to produce more hydrogen.",

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ": That's a great question! While hydrogen has many advantages, there are still technical and economic hurdles to overcome. But let's continue exploring its benefits first.\n\nBecause hydrogen is a gas, it's easily transported through pipelines. In fact, pumping hydrogen through pipelines is more energy efficient than transmitting electricity through power lines. This means hydrogen facilities could be located in regions where production is cheapest—desert regions for solar thermal and photovoltaics, windy regions for wind turbines, and moist regions for biomass—and then transported to meet energy needs of distant communities.",

When you press the gas pedal of a hydrogen-powered car, it sends a warming electric current to this alloy, which is housed in the gas tank. As the alloy heats up, it releases hydrogen, which powers either an internal-combustion engine or an electricity-producing fuel cell. Gas stations of the future may truly be \"gas\" stations!",

Utilities could produce megawatts of electricity by stacking fuel cells. Present-day fuel cells have an efficiency of about 60 percent, which is well above the 34 percent efficiency of a typical coal-fired power plant.\n\nInterestingly, one potential source of hydrogen is coal, which when treated with high-pressure steam and oxygen produces hydrogen gas and methane gas. Burning these gases in a gas turbine results in a coal-to-electricity efficiency as high as 42 percent. If the gases are first run through electricity-producing fuel cells, the efficiency is even higher. Meanwhile, because the coal is not burned directly, fewer pollutants are released into the environment.",

Creating hydrogen from water is an energy-intensive process, however, that is best done using electrolysis, a technique we discussed in Section 11.6.\n\nIdeally, the electrical energy required to create hydrogen from water could be provided by a solar-driven photovoltaic cell. The electricity generated by the cell is then sent to a second cell, where water is electrolytically cleaved to produce hydrogen. Current \"solar fuel\" research seeks to develop photovoltaic surfaces that directly generate hydrogen from water, as shown in textbook Figure 17.41.",

For such systems, the efficiency at which solar energy is converted to hydrogen needs to be as high as possible.\n\nInitial systems had efficiencies of no more than 6 percent. One of the main hurdles was developing a photovoltaic system optimized for 1.23 volts, which is the voltage needed for the hydrolysis of water. Such a system was developed by 1998 and provided an efficiency of 12.4 percent. With newer nanotechnologies now under development, researchers are anticipating efficiencies in excess of 60 percent.",

Such a system would not likely put the centralized utility out of business; instead, it would help the utility cope with ever-increasing energy demands.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the greatest energy growths for the next century will be occurring in developing nations where the infrastructure for centralized energy sources does not exist.

Conversely, the easiest way to defeat a democracy would be to nurture an attitude of voter apathy.\n\nSo, do the minor energy conservation efforts of one individual make a difference? Very much so.
